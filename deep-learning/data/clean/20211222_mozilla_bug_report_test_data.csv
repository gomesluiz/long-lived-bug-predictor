DIRECTORY-485690,created attachment patch v for ldap c sdk this problem is seen in client programs that use ssl clientauth and that use different credentials client certificates on different connections to the same server during the same process lifetime it is also seen in programs that use clientauth on some connections to a server but not on other connections to the same server during the same process lifetime this is seen most commonly is test clients that are trying to simulate different users but it may also be seen in servers that are trying to replicate different data sets to a remote server with a different client credential for each different data set the problem is that after one connection has been established between the client and the server using some or no credential all subsequent connections to the same server may use the same credential or same absent credential even if the client has called ldapssl enable clientauth specifying different credentials to be used for each subsequent connection here is an explanation ssl remembers caches information about previously established sessions with remote clients and servers and reuses that information from old sessions whenever possible to minimize the expensive computational overhead of establishing new sessions with each new connection when a new connection is made if the server says let s reuse the session we last used then the most recent session from that socket s cache will be used even if that previous session was established using different credentials than the client now wishes to use nss s ssl client library supports the use of multiple separate named caches to allow the sessions associated with one set of credentials to be remembered separately from the sessions associated with other sets of credentials so a client program that uses credentials for alice with some sockets and uses credentials for bob with other sockets can have separate caches for alice and bob if the connections for alice are configured to use alice s cache and bob s connections use bob s cache all confusion over different credentials can be eliminated when a program or thread uses a socket for which it has not configured an explicitly named socket then nss uses a default unnamed cache for that socket there is only one default unnamed cache if multiple threads trying to act as separate users do not specify explicitly named caches for their respective users identities then the separate users will end up using a common set of credentials from the common cache resulting in confusion it may be reasonable for all ldap connections that do not use client auth to share a common cache because each connections that uses no client auth typically is re authenticated using some other method such as simple name and password authentication but it is not reasonable for client auth connections to share a cache with connections that use no client auth that is the problem experienced with the ldap c sdk the ldap c sdk never explicitly names a cache to be used with any ssl socket so all ssl sockets share the common unnamed cache with the resulting identity confusion a named cache is implicitly created the first time its name is configured to be used by a socket cache entries have a lifetime after which they expire when all the cache entries for a named cache have expired the cache disappears so it s very easy to use named caches you just give the name to the ssl socket before doing the first handshake on that socket and ssl does the rest i have attempted to modify the ldap c sdk to do that to configure each ssl socket that will be used with a client certificate to use a cache with the same name as the nickname of the cert to be used i have attached to this bug an untested patch that i believe will solve the problem i would like one of the ldap c sdk cognoscenti you know who you are to test this patch and see if it does indeed satisfactorily solve the problem for them ,1

CORE-123267,currently and maybe a few other formatting tags get propagated when they are not closed for example test test will give this div span b test b span test b another example test test will give div span b test b span b test b b this becomes an issue however when one has something like item item item item item item item which will give ul li b item li b b item li b b b item li b b b b item li b b b b b item li b b b b b b item li b b b b b b b item b b b b b b b one idea i had was to not to insert a b when the parent node is already a b but a that will not help in a case like item item item item item item item another idea i had was to use a element that will have its style set according to these formatting tags for example item item item item item item item will become ul li b item li span style font weight bold font size item li span style font weight boldfont size xx small b item li span style font weight boldfont size xx small font size item li span style font weight boldfont size x small b item li span style font weight boldfont size x small font size item li span style font weight boldfont size small b item span style font weight boldfont size small however it will not work with something like item item item item item item item this feature also causes issues like if i do item item i get ul li b id b item li b id b b id b item b id b b id b at any rate usage of the formatting tags this way is just plain bad html and this way of parsing causes the dom to grow alot larger sometimes causes some content to be lost in the process and sometimes causes moz to freeze slowdown crash on seemingly simple pages see bug for an extreme case i would suggest turning this feature off by closing the formatting tags when the parent tag is closed and evangelize anyone who uses the tags this way and expect it to propagate ,1

CALENDAR-323321,mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv a gecko mozilla sunbird a currently the new day week views allow drag n drop of events via right mouse button too this gives confusing results if you use an operation of the context menu afterwards example after dragging an event to a new position via right mouse button the context menu for that event pops up select edit event and open the edit dialog error you will notice that the dialog still displays the old date time of the event press ok and you will see two event boxes in the view one at the old position and one at the new position example try to resize with the right mouse button error you will move the event instead of resizing if you play around you will find several other problems based on this principle i think the views drag n drop feature should only work via left mouse button ,0

BUGZILLA-274365,according to product component restructure many duplicate bugs on same problem but different product could be closed as dup for example many of thunderbird bugs could be closed as same problem as mai news bug because common product core component mail news sub component was introduced however this has caused other duplicate bugs many users don t care core etc many users search product thunderbird instead of product core if he she uses thunderbird bug is an examle if first line of msg is entire message is detected as a sig and quoting problems are introduced many duped bugs have similar symptom in summary and this bug could be easily found as dup by reporter himself by searching with summary sig if and only if product core is selected a way of generic search is required for non developer users next is an example of categorization by bug reporter s point of view instead developer s view product package or unit mozilla browser or firefox mail news or thunderbird mozilla composer or standalone composer and so on bug status a valid open confirmed not fixed yet b valid open or dup a or fixed dup c valid open or dup or fixed b or fixed resolved verified recently d may valid or dup or fixed c or unconfirmed or wontfix or invalid recently on search above is expanded to appropriate product component or relution status automatically categrization in search is different in each search but predefined categorization will be useful for initial bug search i think it will be a way to reduce duplicate bugs i think d in above example is usually required it can be pre defined set of saved search initially and is sufficient for browser firefox and mozilla and mail thundeird and mozilla only initially although html javascript serversidescript is better as generic search in future in addition to above pre defined bug list heading should be more kind to users since default header is designed for program owner is it not approprite for initial duplicated bug search owner name is not needed for user my customization example is as follows idlast changed dateresolutionstatuscompsummary full although headers can be easily customized initial setting for non developer is preferable because developers have sufficient knowledge on bugzilla but usual users are usually not and many of bugzilla mozilla org users are usual users bug reporters third some limitation on number of search result is required if number of hits is very large it takes very long time in both searching and listing of results this causes frustration of uers result listing of is meaningless for users reporting hit count only is better if number of hits exceeds a limit this will also reduce server s workload ,1

FIREFOX_BUILD_SYSTEM-362392,a few things can be done to reduce the number of stat calls performed by mddepend pl the loop which iterates over dependencies see lines in the sample url could be broken into two passes the first pass only checks the alldeps cache for each dependency and saves each dep that isn t in the cache the second pass only runs if necessary and actually stats the deps that were skipped during the first pass the cache checking code doesn t distinguish between deps that haven t been stat ed and aren t in the cache and deps that don t exist and are in the cache with a time of undef as a result a dep that doesn t exist is rechecked for each target that depends on it alldeps is initialize incorrectly the on line is a hash reference so alldeps ends up with a bogus target named hash xsomething this causes an extra pass through the target loop line should probably just be my alldeps in my simple tests these changes reduce the number of stat calls by roughly most of the benefit is from if nobody else jumps on this i ll submit a patch this weekend ,1

TAMARIN_GRAVEYARD-432541,created attachment patch major restructuring of the interpreter tracer and forth compiler to improve interpreter speed note that this patch is mac only for now testing and fixing on other platforms will be done soon and the patch revised accordingly big picture is that the forth compiler now tries to identify superword candidates and generate them when possible even for subsections of existing words it s no longer necessary or legal to use the super keyword in forth mac release builds are around twice as fast as current tip in interp mode tt old tt new prime access binary trees access fannkuch access nbody access nsieve bitops bit bits in byte bitops bits in byte bitops bitwise and bitops nsieve bits crypto md crypto sha math cordic math partial sums math spectral norm s d cube s d morph s d raytrace string fasta in trace mode speedup is less dramatic but a few tests did see nontrivial speedups the code for implementing each primitive has been moved from interpreter cpp into prim fs the interp section implements the interpreter stage the trace section the trace step from these the forth compiler will generate two loops an interpreter loop designed for maximum speed complete with superwords and a tracer loop used when tracing a hot path for possible jitting making these two seaparte loops gives a little code redundancy but allows the c compiler to do a better job of optimizing the interpreter and trace loops themselves are compiled in a new file vm interp cpp which is used by interpreter cpp primitives now use a syntax of prim primname argsin argsout interp c code goes here trace c code goes here note that a trailing semicolon is now required you must specify both trace and interp blocks for all prims except stack motion prims dup etc only specify trace blocks the interp blocks are provided by the forth compiler and function primitives can omit the trace block if they do then a default one is autogenerated the format syntax of the interp trace sections in prim fs is still a little ragged and might change a bit e g i am using the forth parsing code to read in the c code meaning that there is exaggerated white space at times since that s all the forth parser looks for the main knobs to control superword generation are maxnest which will inline words to a certain nesting depth rather than issuing nest and superlen which defines the minimum length a potential superword must be in forth instructions in order to be superworded you can use these on the command line to set the global defaults but it s much more useful to set them on a per word basis you can do this by editing core wordmods txt which currently defines a handful of words as cold no nesting or supering or hot aggressive nesting and supering there s lots more tuning that could be done here by adding words and or tuning the granularity there should definitely be some profiling done to see what other words might benefit from being marked as hot or warm you can have different settings for different words typical settings result in a few hundred superwords being generated meaning there just wasn t space in bytecode to do what we needed so the forth opcodes are now bit words thus the token wcodep wcodepp types are gone replaced by fopcode fopcodep fopcodepp the various invoke primitives iinvokeii etc were all removed since we can now devote a single opcode for each such call and generation of the trace code can be derived based on new information added to callinfo since we have such a huge amount of opcode space due to huge words all extern words in forth get an opcode dedicated to them this is basically a nest internally but it allows more compact forth generation in il cpp other notes rewrote getdefaultnamespace and createstacktrace in forth so that they could use currentframe this means we no longer have any function primitives that access interp currentframe and thus don t have to stop a trace for them do we still need interp currentframe at all added avmplus unaligned access define to avmbuild h this is used instead of various intel checks to indicate whether it s safe to do unaligned word long access added a forthonly flag to builtin py passing this regenerates forth but not the builtin as code turned on fstrict aliasing and wstrict aliasing in xcode builds and fixed a few things that broke as a result mostly in mathutils,0

NSPR-30746,in the combined mxn thread model the current implementation of nspr converts the primordial thread into a local thread and uses the underlying native thread as an execution entity to run local threads and the idle thread part of the nspr thread scheduler this implementation strategy is problematic when the primordial thread calls a native blocking function that blocks the underlying native thread thus preventing the other local threads and the idle thread on that execution entity from running on windows nt this problem may manifest itself as follows a thread calls an nspr i o function and hangs in nt io wait this is because on windows nt nspr uses the idle threads to read the i o completion port but the idle thread by default only one is created is blocked this can be worked around by calling pr setconcurrency n where n is an interger larger than at the beginning of the main function to create additional idle threads pr createthread hangs trying to acquire the internal lock pr activelock which is being held by the internal thread timermanager prmwait c the timermanager thread is created during nspr initialization as a local thread which at the time is runnable but cannot be scheduled to run because the native blocking function called by the primordial thread blocks the underlying execution entity i am not sure if pr setconcurrency can work around this problem one workaround is to create a global thread to run the real main function and join with that global thread this problem has been reported so many times that i think it needs to be fixed i propose that we leave the primordial thread as a plain native thread and create a new native thread as the execution entity to run local threads and the idle thread this will create one more native thread than the current implementation does but it will save us and our clients from wasting time in debugging this problem down the road ,1

problems you must always reencode the message to bit quoted printable prior signing as stated in rfc transfer encoding for signing using multipart signed if a multipart signed entity is ever to be transmitted over the standard internet smtp infrastructure or other transport that is constrained to bit text it must have transfer encoding applied so that it is represented as bit text mime entities that are bit data already need no transfer encoding entities such as bit text and binary data can be encoded with quoted printable or base transfer encoding for verifying mails have to be always encoded back to bit quoted printable prior verifying theoretically the mail within my sent folder bit signed should be invalid but it is not because you do not canonicalize the data before verifying which is an rfc violation too solution if the mail is bit reencode it to bit quoted printable before you sign if a signed mail is bit reencode it to bit quoted printable before you verify reproducible always steps to reproduce deactivated the setting edit preference mail newsgroups composition for messages that contain bit characters use quoted printable mime encoding and sign an email with smime using bit characters i e german umlauts actual results invalid signature on recieving clients and also mozilla or any other for that matter expected results reencode message to quoted printable bit

BUGZILLA-13534,i think that we should endeavour to remove remind and later from bugzilla i believe that they achieve more harm than good there are many disadvantages a they can easily not appear as queries after all they are unresolved b effort to reopen resulting in comments activity which clutter the bug report c they are usually set by netscape employees and hence imply netscape s agenda for what will go in mozilla at least is a open project where anyone can contribute so what s the alternative the obvious answer is the milestone remind can already be handled by moving the bugs to a later milestone where they need to get reevaluated remind could even get turned into a bug flag see bug for later there needs to be an no target milestone this means that there is currently no plan for implementation but it has been considered and hence won t appear on groups new bugs radar ie having a blank milestone which might be renamed to to be considered this would require a little modification of queries by netscape employees to exclude untargetted bug reports but they generally know how to use bugzilla it is a lot more important that bugzilla newbies can quickly find the issues that do not have a target date and they should help out on and point a can prevent this this combined with the introduction of assigning to nobody mozilla org covers all the issues that i know of note that this works just as well for closed or in house projects that use bugzilla ,1

CORE-980630,created attachment patch when an oom occurs during inference we nuke all type information in the zone and disable inference this behavior is incompatible with bug and it isn t really necessary anymore it was originally in place because with a web of interdependent constraints we are left in an inconsistent state if an oom occurs in the middle of solving those constraints but now constraints are not interdependent and can only trigger recompilation of particular scripts or invalidation of new script information the attached patch removes type nuking and instead relies on other mechanisms such as marking type sets as unknown when oom occurs inference apis are generally left alone and still generally infallible there are a few places where oom can leave us in a place that isn t easy to recover from such as when copying data during gc sweeping or when adding scripts to the pending recompilation list in these places we just moz crash it doesn t seem worth it to add a new mechanism to recover here when crashes here aren t easy to trigger and the rest of the browser just crashes on oom anyways ,0

SEAMONKEY-145048,so after weeks of trial and error i finally figured out how to playback the offline actions but i ve found that the whole system is quite precarious the actual functionality is tremendously useful and powerful but it is so hard to use that its almost worthless as i see it and maybe i ve got this wrong too you do a download sync and then go into offline mode or click on the offline icon and then download sync from the dialog that part works fine the problem is basically that the next time you click the online button the playback begins whether or not you can actually talk to the server or not not to mention that if you go online from the browser window the playback will never occur or at least i sure as heck can t figure out if its actually happening in any case you only seem to get one shot at the playback then its all lost and all your folders go back to the state they were on the server you only get one chance then you re screwed here are a few situations that have bit me today i came in after doing a whole bunch of offline work and plugged in my laptop i clicked the offline button in the mail status bar but i forgot to plug it into the network i got about failed to connect to nsmail mcom com dialog boxes before i realized what was happening so i plugged in the network cable and the rest of the playback seemed to go ok so about of my offline folders seemed to actually sync correctly the other folders seem to have gone back to the way they were before i went offline hours earlier another way this has affected me is if i connect my laptop to the internet but don t have access to my company s mail server i e outside the firewall i don t want to loose all the offline work i did for that server yet another odd case is when i m using netscape s webmail and their authentication system fails to connect to the server which happens about of the time but that s netscape s bug then i loose all offline sync info for that server and i m basically screwed for that sync and finally once or twice i ve accidentally clicked the offline icon while i m actually offline sending me back into online mode once again all my offline changes are lost so anyhow here s what i think should happen which should pretty much solve all these problems every time you go online from any window the mail window should ask would you like to sync your offline work with the server now so at least the user knows that the sync is happening or optionally if you go online from the browser window the mail window would just remember that you had just gone online and when it got focus it could ask you when the offline sync begins if the first connection to a server fails it should ask something along the lines of i can t seem to connect to would you like to continue syncing with this server instead of this ininformative can t connect to then it could continue trying to sync with the other servers cc ing jglick for ui behavior advice i don t think this feature has been completely thought out or at least nobody has tried to use it in real world situations ,1

function splurge var d popup document d write d write this is your titlehelloo d close hello additional comments from eddie xu i am pretty sure we don t have this problem before but not sure how long ago at that time popup window did not render about blank initially i used to test stuff like popup window open http www yahoo com popup resizeto and it used to work it doesn t anymore additional comments from adam lock eddie window methods should work immediately but the window document property won t work until the document viewer has been created and associated with the window and the document viewer won t be created until the uriloader tells the docshell s content listener that there is some content to render this minor gap between the window opening and the document viewer being present perhaps we could make process atomic for about blank or wait in window open for the first content to arrive before returning ideas additional comments from eddie xu the two lines popup window open http www yahoo com popup resizeto is the exact codes i tested and it does not work unfortunately i can not block inside nsiembeddingsitewindow createbrowserwindow and peek for document viewer because it will never be created before i return from createbrowserwindow additional comments from rick potts hey eddie i ve spent some time tracing through both your cases popup document and popup resizeto and it turns out that they are related in the popup document case it is just as adam described no document is available because nothing has loaded yet in the popup resizeto case things are a bit more funny it is basically failing for the same reason no document however in this situation it is the security manager that is causing the failure basically it is trying to verify that you have the right to call resizeto unfortunately since no document is available it cannot locate a principal this causes it to silently fail the funny part is that there is only a small window of time when you are allowed to call resizeto it will only succeed if it is called after about blank has loaded but before http www yahoo com this is due to security restrictions the bottom line is that when ever you create a new browser window you need to create a nested message pump and block until the initial document probably about blank has been loaded into the webbrowser you can take a look at how mozilla does it at http lxr mozilla org seamonkey source xpfe appshell src nsxulwindow cpp as you also noticed mfcembed does not do the right thing either when creating new windows or with modality in general i ll see if we can fix up mfcebbed to do the right thing as a simpler example rick additional comments from eddie xu thanks adam does fix the painting problem but not the dom in your test case the one with settimeout splurge if we change window open about blank to window open like most site does your example won t work either so this is what i am going to try on the embedding side after a popup window is created i am going to explicitly load about blank and do a message pump and wait for the first onstatechange network done to come in the new window before i return from createbrowserwindow sounds like a right direction to go hi eddie the loading about blank thing was a workaround while we sorted painting problems in new windows for bugscape this now appears to be fixed so i don t believe you need to do it anymore adam additional comments from eddie xu hmm my initial try failed seems like if i do not return from createbrowserwindow the doc loading on the new window will never get completed here is the codes static void waitfordocshellready cgbrowser pnewbrowser cgbrowser pnewbrowser nscomptr piwebnav if piwebnav do queryinterface pnewbrowser m

put some code into docshell that ensures that about protocols are loaded synchronously i have made an initial attempt to do this which does appear to work but it crashes almost immediatly after in the parser i ll attach a patch of my change in the hope that someone might be able to shed light on the reason for the crash to me it looks like the http channel is sending data after i have already

out that before entering the nested event loop a new nsieventqueue must also be pushed i m attaching a patch to mozilla embedding browser webbrowser nsdocshelltreeowner cpp which pushes the new event queue before calling nsiwebbrowserchrome createbrowserwindow this seems to fix the problem additional comments from rick potts created an attachment id patch to push an nsieventqueue before calling

CORE-231199,rigth now the hash for uniqued mapped attributes is case insensitive wrt the values of the attributes this is good and all in theory since it allows us to squeeze more attribute maps together and thus have a smaller rule tree and fewer attribute maps allocated however the disadvantage of having a case insensitive hash is that it s slower then a case sensitive one having a case sensitive one would also make it easier to use the same code for svg and possibly xul and we d be able to save some code there are also some attributes in html that should be case sensitive like background so if we want to keep the current code we need to fix it anyway and it ll speed up the cases where we don t have a lot of elements with the same attributes since hashing case sensitivly is faster the case insensitivly i would think this is a pretty common case too although i don t have any data to back that up and in practice making the hash case sensitive probably won t cause a noticable difference in number of unique maps for a page in most cases where there are a lot of elements with the same attributes the markup is generated either using some gui designer composer frontpage or generated through cgi in both cases it s pretty likly that the same casing will be used everywhere and even for manually created pages i doubt that one and the same page will use more then two or three different casings this also raises the issue of weather we should sort the mapped attributes which we do to make the hash attribute order insensitive however the gain seems a lot smaller here so before anyone does this we should probably investigate weather we d actually win anything as a sidenote i should mention that the current hash is actually partly case sensitive the code to calculate hash values is case sensitive but the code to check equality is not the endresult is that we most of the time already are case sensitive this has been the case since unique attributes were introduced ,0

TESTING-866195,recently when attempting to fix bug to allow autophone to test android devices i ran in an apparent regression in throbberstart due to the change in how fennec is launched while attempting to investigate the regression i ran tests of how fennec is launched comparing the current autophone run fennec with profile method call it a to versions of run fennec with profile which used mozbase s launchfennec without call it b and with call it c the w argument to am there was no consistent ordering between phones of the values values a and b which should have been identical were consistently different in addition the variability of the test results as shown by the standard deviations made it difficult to make accurate comparisons something to note is that i ran a b and c in the same session with the same profile without rebooting in between the variability of the test results is very apparent when looking at the recent results at this is especially true for the remote page tests where the network connections are throttled via ipfw to kbps down and kbps up i do not know whether the throttled network is the cause of the variability or if it has some other cause in my opinion these results are so noisy as to be unusable i checked the performance of the phonedash web server using httperf as compared to nginx for serving the static files for twitter html and did not see any performance issue which might affect the tests this led me to reading up on test reproducibility and got me thinking about how we actually run the tests a simplified description of how autophone runs the s s tests is reboot phone install fennec for cache in disabled enabled create profile with cache preferences launch fennec to initialize the profile for test in local blank local twitter remote blank remote twitter for iteration in iterations launch fennec and load the test page collect and report throbberstart throbberstop values we use the throbberstart and throbberstop values from the iterations to calculate a mean and standard deviation which is displayed on phonedash i see several problems in this approach which may affect the reliability and reproducibility of the tests we test the uncached behavior using prefs to disable the cache i think it would be more realistic if we used the normal cache settings and treated the first load of a page as the uncached test and treated the second load of a page as the cached test we do not reboot the phone in between the test pages nor in between the iterations we treat each test and iteration as an independent measurement when as currently implemented each test and iteration depends upon the previous tests and iterations i think we should reboot before each measurement to eliminate any influences from prior measurements our choice of iterations is ad hoc rather than focusing on the standard deviation of the measurements we can choose the iterations to reduce the standard error of the mean and perhaps obtain more reliable results i think that implementing will help in improving reliability and help in choosing a realistic and useful iteration count for background reading http en wikipedia org wiki standard error and http en wikipedia org wiki standard deviation the proposed test execution would look like reboot phone install fennec launch fennec to make sure the build is usable if fennec is not usable abort test for test in local blank local twitter remote blank remote twitter for iteration in iterations reboot phone create profile launch fennec to initialize the profile launch fennec and load the test page collect and report uncached throbberstart throbberstop values launch fennec and load the test page collect and report cached throbberstart throbberstop values i would like to take some of the redundant phones out of the production autophone s s runs to use in testing this approach we could keep the current autophone running in production on the remaining phones until we determine if this is a valid approach if we do switch to this new behavior i can rerun previous data to fill in the historical behavior thoughts ,0

THUNDERBIRD-471223,created attachment fix v not quite up to my usual cvs archaeology standards but at some point in the past in the pre era before smileys were part of the theme we decided to fork editor s packaging so we could package up just the smileys instead of all the images in editor ui composer content icons then after that we realized that although we don t need things like tag body gif which composer shows when you enter the show icons for all html tags mode that we don t have shows tag anchor gif even in the normal view so insert named anchor would have probably shown a broken image icon or maybe just nothing so we added mail components compose content icons tag anchor gif then smileys moved to the theme and here s where my archaeology breaks down whatever it was that was letting us find editor content things in messenger jar rather than comm jar was removed and we went back to packaging all of editor ui composer content icons or maybe we never changed anywhere other than on the aviary branch so now we re just jarring up something which nothing can access since there s no manifest saying to either look for content editor there or to overlay any editor content uri with anything from there doing some restriction of what composer bits and bobs we package wouldn t be a bad thing but copying the files is the wrong approach we should either ifdef editor ui jar mn particularly reasonable given the way we already do ifdef editor ui locales jar mn or do what we do with mailnews jar mn ifdeffing the whole thing and jarring what we want with absolute paths from a file in mail instead ,0

CORE_GRAVEYARD-226406,even after the checkin for bug we still spend a fair amount of time in font matching and it s not speedy so we should strive to do it as little as possible one thing i noticed is that we create mminifont up front for a nsfontxft even though very few pages need to draw an unknown glyph character we re spending nearly as much time doing font matching for the mini font as for the main font i think we should instantiate the mini font only as needed it s also worth noting that the mini fonts could be reused across nsfontxft instances since the mini font depends only the size and weight of the primary font not its family i think the lazy instantiation will be a bigger win for now though since we need to draw unknown glyphs infrequently ,0

CORE-227537,we have the potential for a fair speedup across the board on linux at least by some rough measurements by marking most of our functions and methods as having hidden visibility using attribute visibility hidden in particular we can do this for the following types of functions all methods and functions which are not to be called from outside of the dso all functions and methods in our xpcom component libraries because these are only ever called from other dsos via vtables with the special exception of nsgetmodule what does this buy us you save a trip through the plt for each call one load and one jump if a function does not access global variables and calls only functions marked static or hidden you save some instructions at the beginning of the function to set up the pic register and you gain ebx as a general purpose register in that function to boot hidden visibility also applies to global data though the savings isn t quite as much so now the question is how we could apply this to the code base with the minimal amount of work there are a few possibilities a macro on each method declaration it could be folded into ns imethod too but we d want a version that doesn t declare virtual and stdcall implement per class visibility in gcc and use a macro on each class declaration implement a global fvisibility hidden switch in gcc and explicitly mark the methods we want to export most of these are already annotated with ns export for win options and obviously don t buy us anything immediately and depend on getting a gcc patch done and checked in and probably waiting for the next gcc release that contains it they do however make the mozilla code less messy isn t really that hard i even have a rough patch although visibility is a bit hosed in general on the gcc trunk requires a lot more thought and we could have a difficult time getting concensus on that you have to come up with a mechanism to know that all of your symbols from dsos that you link with will not be hidden ,1

CORE-433030,the code cleanup changes in attachment accidentally changed the intended logic when capslock is on and cmd and shift are down and layout is latin my bad the intended logic could be restored easily but it seems the intended logic may not be best the original intended logic before the clean up was designed due to a situation seen on the german keyboard layout this layout has u df eszett and on one key the is accessed with shift however when cmd shift are down the os sends the character the original intended logic was designed assuming that this was something special and that the user might have meant a cmd however is available as shift so i don t believe that the user ever would intend a when typing cmd it looks like the real reason for the os providing cmd shift when the user types cmd cmd shift on a german layout is that on a us layout cmd looks like cmd shift and the os may use cmd shift to detect the help shortcut cmd so there are two overlapping issues here when the modifier state is capslock cmd shift the character code from any latin key sent to javascript would be the character code that the os sends with cmd shift but the character code that we would like is the one that the keyboard produces with capslock shift when the modifier state is cmd shift and the key from any latin or non latin key is a key for which the os provided character with cmd depends on the state of shift the character sent to javascript is the character that the os sends with cmd shift but the character code that we would like is the one that the keyboard produces with only shift most often the os provided character with cmd does not depend on the state of shift but with german and other keys it does a fix for these issues has been posted in attachment but i m filing a separate bug so that discussion of this issue is clearly separated ,0

SEAMONKEY-26798,as it stands it appears that all builds of mozilla display a build id string at the bottom right of the browser window even when it is wrong and misleading other than offical builds the current date and time is not used because if it were the id could be newer than the code that was build see bug for that on the other hand as it is any non official build including those that may get wide distribution like the debian frozen m binary which had the nonsensical build id of see bug and bug display some build id the danger is that another non official build might get wide distribution with an out of date but believable build id a week or two old wreaking havoc on the ability of bug screeners to tell a regression from a dup of a fixed bug and for that matter a milestone release from a nightly binary in general though it s a bad idea to be displaying inaccurate build ids as both the bug writing guidelines at http www mozilla org quality bug writing guidelines html and the bugzilla helper at http www mozilla org quality help bug form html ask for the build id string and asking for the identity of the build in more than one way is unlikely to be helpful for getting good info from beginning bug reporters the better solution is probably along the lines of having a file deep in the seamonkey tree overwritten with the build id string each hour by at least two cron jobs running on at least two machines and then setting up the non official build process to interpolate the contents of that file rather than using the build time for the build id that way if a day or two go by before the build the id will still reflect the age of the code but not ever be older than the code a less preferable alternative would be to drop the build id display from builds that are more than n days more recent than the code built since the build id is a number that gets used elsewhere too it couldn t be surpressed itself so this would mean conditional compilation of the code that displays it complicating things that s still better than collecting build ids in bug reports that are just plain wrong though from people who would never know the difference ,1

CORE-83536,currently we have several implementation types for nsiprincipal nscodebaseprincipal nscertificateprincipal nsaggreagteprincipal which groups a codebase with a certificate and nssystemprincipal all of which inherit from nsbaseprincipal merging the first three types into a single implementation class has several advantages clarity ease of use currently to see the url associated with a principal callers have to get an nsiprincipal and qi it to an nsicodebaseprincipal merging these types saves a qi and makes call sites simpler performance all principals associated with documents are aggregateprincipals which means that almost every function call on those objects results in two virtual function calls one to the aggregateprincipal and one to the underlying codebaseprincipal eliminating the indirection would speed things up a bit the indirection provided by aggregateprincipals is necessary for pages that set document domain since this changes the document s principal and the change must be reflected both in the document s principal and the principal of any event handlers compiled for that page i think we can solve this by adding a setdomain function to the principal itself ,1

FIREFOX-420556,created attachment patch v fixes problem the sidebar header on gnome has a transparent background because its moz appearance toolbox rule overrides its background color moz dialog rule which causes problems for theming engines like personas that expect the header to have an explicit background color as it does on mac and windows the moz appearance rule also overrides rules specifying top and bottom borders and it s unclear why there are these contradictory rules but the rules are the same as in winstripe where moz appearance does not override the other rules so perhaps they were simply copied from windows to linux verbatim in that case the intent would have been for the header to have the specified background color moz dialog which we can do by simply removing the moz appearance nevertheless that also causes the explicit border rules to be applied and i looked at three other gnome apps with sidebars totem gthumb and evolution and none of them give their sidebar headers borders although evolution gives it a different background color plus borders look funky with the native gtk splitter which is borderless so i think the header should remain borderless while fixing the background color issue which we can do by removing both the moz appearance rule and the top and bottom border rules here s a patch that does that note there are other things i noticed while investigating this issue like that we use a widget sidebarheader with no xbl binding that we put its styles in toolkit instead of browser on linux and windows it s in browser on mac although there s at least one funky rule there as well and that we pad the header label by four pixels on the left which causes it to be misaligned with text in the sidebar itself f e the search label in the bookmarks sidebar but i ll file those as separate bugs requesting wanted firefox for this theme polish fix that has implications for extensibility ,0
