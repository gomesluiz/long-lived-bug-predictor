CORE-355430,user agent mozilla macintosh u intel mac os x en us rv gecko firefox build identifier mozilla macintosh u intel mac os x en us rv gecko firefox firefox supports window onerror from internet explorer as a way of handling any javascript errors that go uncaught window onerror function msg url line when this function is invoked in internet explorer the javascript stack from when the error was thrown is available using arguments caller callee in ie it s as though the exact line where the error was caused calls the window onerror function in firefox the stack information is not available in this way i think the best thing to do and which i wish ie did rather than calling onerror with the stack intact is to expose the actual object that was thrown and not caught in fx this object already has the stack property which will provide a good amount of information about the state of the javascript stack when the error was thrown additionally any object that custom javascript code throws should also be available in the onerror function so i can think of two quick and dirty ways of exposing the thrown object one is to add a fourth parameter to the onerror function window onerror function msg url line err another would be to save the last uncaught error as a property of the window object window onerror function msg url line var err window mozlasterror i think that this change would be very helpful for developers working on complex javascript applications we are used to java where we can wrap the main function in a try catch print stack trace statement for diagnosis of any problem because javascript browser has so many possible entry points event handlers window settimeout loading etc there is not an easy idiom to use that replicate this catch all functionality window onerror is the obvious mechanism to use but to be fully useful it needs to somehow expose the state of the stack when the error was raised reproducible always steps to reproduce window onerror function msg url line window alert hey no access to the stack var willthrow nothing nope nada an error,1

THUNDERBIRD-494962,this bug is about adding some third party oss code to thunderbird the criteria that drive me to suggest them are the following a we want to have a development platform that is as easy to work with for as many people as possible both for add on authors and core contributors b if we can include open source code which is well maintained and provides unique modular capabilities that fit well with our stack then we should consider including them c we want to enable rich interactions and user experiences and building frameworks to support these in house is a huge investment which even the firefox team is unable to do witness the lack of an animation framework even though there s lots of ux desire for more animation support today doing visualizations or animations in tb is currently very hard because the platform doesn t provide it i m proposing that we include two libraries protovis for visualizations as i use in bugs and jquery some of jqueryui for easy dom css manipulation including animation and fade effects some background protovis is described at http vis stanford edu protovis it s an actively developed project by the people behind prefuse and flare which were both very popular but flash based systems protovis is heavily based on technologies we promote such as canvas in their first version svg in their current version and advanced javascript usage protovis is covered under the bsd license so is easy for us to include the examples are worth looking at to get an idea of the capabilities of the package http vis stanford edu protovis ex the authors of protovis have made changes to the code to make it easier for us to include e g avoiding namespace pollution providing a versioning scheme and if we have specific objections i think it s likely we can get them to make changes protovis is not only useful to deliver compelling features but also provides a really simple way for us to provide a great visualization toolkit as part of the thunderbird platform as an example the tag pie feature see http ascher ca blog getting insight into ones own email which i don t think is useful enough to include in thunderbird is trivial to build as an extension the visualization bit is as follows var tagpie render function tagpie render let data let totalcount for each tag count in iterator this tagcounts totalcount count data push count this taginfo tag tag this tagservice getcolorforkey this taginfo tag key if data length return data sort function ab a b let tagpie this context idoc createelement div tagpie setattribute id tagpie tagpie setattribute class tagpie this context idoc getelementbyid column appendchild tagpie let vis new this context pv panel canvas tagpie vis width height let scale math pi totalcount let wedge vis add this context pv wedge data data left top outerradius angle function d d scale fillstyle function d d wedge anchor center add this context pv label text function d d vis render there is obviously some implied commitment to deal with eventual bugs maintenance releases and figure out an upgrade strategy like with any embedded rd party software given the low complexity of the package one javascript file this feels like an overall win andrew sutherland is the likely person who d own maintaining protovis given his interest in visualization and use of protovis in the past see exptoolbar open questions where in the tree would this go how should it go i would suggest that it be loaded as chrome content messenger protovis js so we can update minor bugfix releases but have to explicitly change things if there s a non backwards compatible major version update jquery jquery ui jquery is available under the mit license the big drivers for jquery inclusion are in my opinion support for animations and effects would be really really easy at least for html parts of the ui it would provide a massively popular layer of utility code which we currently lack in particular around dom manipulation i don t think that all of jqueryui is ripe for inclusion though the widgets in particular would i suspect be too hard to integrate from a look and feel point of view and the interactions are not that useful but the jqueryui core effects would give us of the benefit while limiting scope a few other points about jquery i suspect but have no real data to back it up that there are an order of magnitude more developers using jquery and filing bugs against it and testing it than any bit of gecko let alone comm central jetpack for firefox embeds jquery for many of the same reasons that i argue we should jquery had a reputation for stepping hard on other libraries that has afaik been fixed and you can even use jquery w o the function but using jquery which we may want to say is a requirement for in tree code if the scares people the cost to the tb team of maintaining jquery is likely even less than protovis because it has hundreds of thousands of users and is already embedded in a lot of products apple nokia microsoft etc all use jquery in various ways i don t think i need to remind people that jresig works for moco if thunderbird provided built in protovis jquery combined w our much better js apis folderpane gloda whatever part of steel we end up with i think we have an exciting and solid platform to get add on authors excited a few other notes i don t know what the download size delta would be but i would be surprised if it was significant given that we can ship minified js code if we want if we go ahead we will have to think about when we update these third party libraries much like the gecko guys think about when to update sqlite discussion it d be good to have this discussion soon as the two bugs mentioned above require protovis and are currently blocking tb b ,1
CORE-326714,n b most people don t use builds with the code that this bug is complaining about it s not enabled in release builds since disable gnomeui defaults to doing a configure test for the version and the build machines don t currently have that version although that could change in the future but it does show up in builds that people do on relatively new distributions the gnome icon code in modules libpr n decoders icon gtk is really really slow i ve described this on irc in the past and some people had useful suggestions on my machine it takes a few hundred milliseconds per icon this is a significant slowdown just when opening a dialog that has ok and cancel buttons since we do two such icon loads in that case at least the first time but it s a much much more serious problem for bookmarks where we do an icon load for every single file url in any displayed bookmarks if a bookmarks folder or the personal toolbar has a lot of file urls in it this is a huge slowdown and can lead to multi second delays waiting for bookmarks menus to open using some printf timing since profiling of things involving x server etc can be a little unreliable the slowest pieces of nsiconchannel initwithgnome seem to be the call to gnome icon lookup typically around ms the g object unref of the icon theme odd typically around ms the pixmap manipulation from there to the end of the function varies a lot sometimes it s almost instantaneous sometimes it s near ms sometimes in between when i brought this up on irc a bunch of people had suggestions for improving the last part but that s actually not the bulk of the time i don t think mozilla should ship this code in official builds until these problems are resolved ,0

NSS-135261,the ssl documentation recommends that servers that wish to require ssl cert based client authentication should set ssl require certificate to pr false and then check for the presence of a cert on the ssl socket after the handshake is complete e g when getting the client s request and deny the request at that time if the cert is absent there s a problem with doing that with the current implementation of ssl require certificate the problem occurs when an ssl client has previously established an ssl session with the server one that did not include client authentication and that has not expired when the client connects to the server again if ssl require certificate is pr false the ssl code will simply restart the existing ssl session and will not do a new full ssl handshake with the result that the user s cert is not requested from the client and the client repeatedly receives whatever error message the server sends back when client auth is absent in that same situation if ssl require certificate is pr true ssl will refuse to restart the old ssl session and will instead force a new full ssl handshake requesting client authentication but if the client does not have cert the ssl library will terminate the handshake and the tcp connection which doesn t allow the server to send back a better error message this is the behavior that the ssl documentation recommends not to do so what is needed is another setting of ssl require certificate one that behaves partly like pr true in that it refuses to restart old ssl sessions if they didn t do client auth but also behaves partly like pr false in that it allows the ssl handshake to continue and doesn t terminate the tcp connection if the client fails to provide client auth i can think of a couple of ways to implement this one is to change the behavior of ssl when ssl require certificate is pr false so that it behaves as described in the preceeding paragraph that change would assume that any server that requests ssl client auth really is going to require it and is not going to allow operations other than returning error message to proceed without a client cert another is to create a new value for ssl require certificate that is neither pr false nor pr true there actually already exists one such undocumented value ssl require certificate can be set to prbool then it behaves as for pr true but only on the first handshake on a tcp connection it behaves like pr false on subsequent handshakes so one could propose the new value prbool to have the behavior described above comments on the choice of these is invited soon i will attach patches that implement these proposals ,1

MAILNEWS_CORE-472005,the bayesian filter tokenizer currently sees headers that are set by mailnews itself such as the keywords header this causes some strange feedback effects particularly in the case of applying soft tags since the existance of the keyword itself is obviously a very strong indicator for soft tagging with that header then whether the header is present or not has a strong effect on the calculated trait match percent this causes after the fact trait bayesian percentage calculations to differ dramatically in some cases from the cases where the filter is applied during normal message reciept which is very confusing it is actually worse than that the most common time when you train with a keyword applied is when you are correcting a false positive in that case the presence of the keyword in the message is an anti indicator of the need for the keyword this causes an oscillation in values as the keyword is removed if present or placed if absent on subsequent after the fact calculations i need to decide whether to hard wire the tokenizer to ignore headers set by mailnews itself or implement some sort of interface to allow extensions to manipulate the tokenizer ,1

FIREFOX-352216,the new versions of the small back forward nav icons have three problems the tips of the arrows are drawn at an angle that s just different than degrees this causes some odd antialiasing at normal size the arrow tips appear to change angle halfway through and the points are a bit thick because there s so little room to define these shapes i d suggest making the small icons use degree angles for the tips and leave the large icons as is the backs of the arrow stems look chopped off at normal size on the large icons these backs have a light column of pixels inside a dark edge that s just a bit lighter than the top bottom edges on the small icons the effect is subtle the light column especially on the current right arrow is almost impossible to see as different and the dark column appears noticeably lighter than the top bottom edges because of this the arrows don t look closed i suggest changing the small icons to make the back column of pixels be as dark as the top bottom rows to make the edge more defined perhaps the light column inside the dark edge could be lightened as well but i m not as sure on that one the small icons appear to be reversed note the position of the spherical reflections inside compared with the large icons image to follow demonstrating these issues ,0

CORE-449356,currently gfxpangofontgroup font selection uses pango itemize and that uses a pangofcfontmap to find the faces most closely matching the css properties making the user font faces available to the pango provided pangofcfontmap would require adding the faces to the current global fcconfig switching between multiple fcconfig s to avoid fonts being used outside the document or element would be clumsy and likely duplicate much data although it would be possible to filter out foreign user font faces between the pangofcfontmap and pango itemize within gfxpangofontgroup but keeping the faces other users of fontconfig would require hacks to replace symbols in system libraries a better approach would be to refactor the gfxpangofontgroup font selection implementing a new pangofcfontmap would be sufficient to enable user font face selection but it may be better to replace the pango itemize functionality currently used using pango shapers requires being able to construct a pangofont from a face the best way to do this is to implement a pangofcfont using a cairo scaled font t constructed from the face ,1

CORE-336559,currently the accepted model for injecting functions into components utils evalinsandbox is to simply stick the functions on the sandbox object itself so in a javascript component one might do var box new components utils sandbox someurl box foo myfoo box bar mybar components utils evalinsandbox untrustedscript box as we saw in bug and friends this lends the untrusted script unwarrented access to the calling chrome code giving it a handle which it might be able to use to pull itself out of the sandbox and run chrome code for bug or more specifically bug we decided to plug all known holes that could lead out of the sandbox but that is really a stopgap solution we should come up with a better way of exposing functions bug comment describes one such solution it has the advantage that all objects in the sandbox are created in the sandbox so following anybody s proto or parent chain won t get you anywhere the major hurdle to that solution however is that a chrome function that returns an object as opposed to a primitive such as a string re opens the hole the patch in that bug attempts to use basically return eval uneval rval however this fails pretty quickly for native objects i m filing this bug to find a solution that makes everybody happy whether we continue with bug s approach or find a better one ,1

ADD-ON_SDK_GRAVEYARD-653495,in sdk bug we landed support for regexes in match patterns for page mods i e script mods and in css bug dbaron just landed support for them in moz document rules but the implementations are different and since we plan to use moz document rules to implement style mods they should be the same so identical regexes can be used to specify the pages to which both script and style mods apply the restrictions on regexes in moz document rules are based on those in the html pattern attribute in particular the pattern must match the entire value not just any subset somewhat as if it implied a at the start of the pattern and a at the end the expression is compiled with the global ignorecase and multiline flags disabled at first glance we should be able to apply these restrictions to the patterns the sdk accepts for script mods by validating the patterns against the rules and automatically enclosing them in and the only restriction that feels like it might be painful is ignorecase although i think there s a way to write a regular expression for any url whose case one wants to ignore i don t know whether we could instead loosen the restrictions in moz document rules presumably they are partly about fitting patterns into single string values dbaron can you speak to that if we decide to implement these restrictions in the sdk we should at least document them in b even if we don t land the implementation by then so we don t break the api later ,0

CORE-38378,first some background as provided to me by the ever helpful attinasi cssframeconstructor attributechanged is called this is were the restyling happens first the content object is asked what the impact of the change is given an attribute and a value it can indicate a reconstruction a reframe or a simple visual change for reconstruct the entire document is torn down and rebuilt pretty harsh for a reframe a new frame is created for the affected content and normal frame construction style resolution takes place for a visual change we ask the framemanager to compute the style change impact this walks up the frames getting the style contexts from them and re resolves the style on each one reresolve style runs through all of the style rules for the content and any pseudo style associated with it and sets the new style values as it goes it checks if the style context actually changes and if it does it appends the new context to a list of changes it also keeps track of the kinds of changes that are made indicating if there needs to be a reflow a reframe or just a repaint depending on the results of the resolutions we then either reconstruct the frames issue a reflow or update paint the views end of attinasi missive so this means that the best case scenario for an attribute change is that we walk every frame in the document and reresolve the style on each one then we decide what to do with it and in the best case again we do nothing or issue a paint i guess as an example of why i really want to fix this behaviour scrolling a gfx scrollbar sets the curpos attribute lots like lots and lots so i hacked up a patch which i will attach below it keeps a list on each style sheet of each attribute that actually appears in a selector and then checks against that table when an attribute changes only if that attribute can affect style context do we do the re resolve dance with this patch i spit out a for each style reresolution that i manage to skip and a for each one that has to happen anyway no attribute involved in the reresolution or attribute that mattered i scrolled the checkin rules page down and then back up and got the following so damn it looks like we can win pretty huge here but of course it s not quite that easy i m apparently causing not quite enough action in the layout engine at times because some needed updates aren t happening as an example while the document scrolls the scroll thumb doesn t move and image rollovers as found on my old nemesis http www honda com don t work maybe i need to fire a paint at the minimum maybe i m blocking reresolutions too aggressively and need to be more careful that i only block the ones that are directly from the attributechanged notification and not from other paths through that code i m not sure yet but i wanted to throw this out for people to poke at while i ponder i think the patch will build but some files did get touched lightly when i updated before the diff and there are some other unrelated i think changes in my layout tree no warranty express or implied ,0

TOOLKIT-59687,the way it is currently wallet tries to identify the meaning of a field by examining the value of the name attribute of the html input tag sometime a website uses meaningful names like zipcode which makes this job simple but more often than not they use cryptic names like yes that s what is actually found on the apple site for the zipcode field so wallet uses a table that contains url specific mappings for determining the meaning of field names used on specific websites that table has to be quite large in order to support a large number of websites but no matter how large it is there will still be many websites that would not be supported furthermore the table is hosted on a server and pinged at the beginning of every browser session to see if it has changed and needs to be redownloaded this also requires a procedure for maintaining the table on the server and to date none has been put in place and it requires a lot of specialized code in the browser to do the downloading in background mode the way it should be rather than using the name attribute of the input tag wallet could use the displayable text preceding the input tag that s much more meaningful because it has to mean something to the user who is viewing it this would allow the entire mechanism for dealing involving url specific mappings to be discarded significant reduction in the amount of data actually stored in memory and no longer any need to do dynamic updates for a server site ,1

CORE-416455,strange app focus problems happen when you right click on a browser window that belongs to a backgrounded instance of minefield and then cause another window to be opened this problem is a regression caused or at least triggered by the patch for bug it doesn t happen when you roll back that bug s patch attachment str run minefield and make sure at least one browser window is open click on the desktop or another app to put minefield into the background but leave its browser window visible right click on that browser window and from the resulting context menu choose view page source or view page info a new window will appear containing either the page source or the page info minefield will still be in the background and the main menu will remain as before i e it will not switch to the minefield menu this is the correct behavior but left clicking on any of the browser s windows the browser window the page source window or the page info window will not switch the app focus to minefield the main menu will not switch to the minefield menu and it won t be possible to place the keyboard focus into any of its windows this is not correct correct behavior can be restored by clicking on the desktop or another app and then clicking once more on one of minefield s visible windows the easiest way to fix this bug is to roll back the patch for bug given sufficient time i may be able to find another way to fix it but we don t have a lot of time before the firefox release ,0

NSS-356215,security mozilla org received the following from ulrich kuehn dear security group i ve found an implementation bug in handling a certain rsa signature padding format that allows a man in the middle attack on ssl and tls connections under certain circumstances i ll go into details below the bug seems to be present in versions and earlier of firefox and potentially of other mozilla software that uses the nss subsystem i noticed that the problem is resolved in the firefox since beta on the ftp server marked as of aug however i ask you to backport a patch to the current version as i believe that users should not be forced to do a major version upgrade due to a security bug that could easily be fixed and the fix is really easy see attached diff maybe the maintainer updating the code did not notice that this seemingly small bug has some severe consequences now for the technical details this bug is somewhat related on a mathematical level to the recent bug that daniel bleichenbacher found for pkcs signature verification nevertheless it does not involve any asn parsing the problem is in security nss lib softoken rsawrapr c function rsa checksign check the padding that was used if buffer buffer goto loser for i i modulus len hash len i if buffer i break if buffer i xff goto loser make sure we get the same results if port memcmp buffer modulus len hash len hash hash len goto loser this code runs over the pkcs padding but would accept an early byte so that a padding of g hash with any garbage in g provided g is long enough to put the hash into the correct place for the following memcmp a word of acknowledgement is due here this code was independently found by hal finney however the consequences seem not be known to him see http www mail archive com cryptography metzdowd com msg html producing a fake signature i e a non signature that is nevertheless accepted by this code is rather easy when an rsa exponent is used for usual key lengths potentially also some larger exponents with longer keys as the unchecked part provides enough play ground for an adversary if you are interested i could provide some more detail here on the mathematics the key point is that with exponent you can use computing rd roots over the real numbers not modulo n the rsa modulus the former is easy while the hardness of the latter is the usual security assumption for rsa so basically when a certificate uses exponent we can produce a fake signature that is accepted by this code here is how to exploit that the function rsa checksign is called during ssl tls connection setup when the server sends a serverkeyexchange message this message contains new keys to be used by the client for exchange of the premaster secret the keys are signed by the key in the server certificate for validation the firefox client computes the md sha combined hash of the key parameters plus the public random bytes and checks that against the signature of the server using the rsa checksign function so a man in the middle attack is easy when a site uses a certificate containing an rsa key with exponent the adversary sends the certificate he does not have the private key and then also sends a serverkeyexchange message containing the fake signature this can easily be produced only the computation is quick so basically the certificate chain can be exploited to make the client believe it is connected to the original server while it is not phishing etc is easy now if you have any further questions please do not hesitate to contact me attached you will find my gpg key and a diff of the relevant portion of against b which fixes the problem please seriously consider providing a patch for with best regards ulrich kuehn,0

CORE-528857,i m seeing some screwy behaviour with tmflags assembly names get associated with instructions for the debug output afaict memory holding lir is being recycled eg different instructions in different fragments that are compiled at different times may end up at the same address in memory however the lirnamemap seems to be staying live across the compilation of these different fragments and so inappropriate names are being given to instructions in the second fragment i ve attached some output that shows this first i turned off addname which manually names some interesting instructions because it just confuses things xt is the instruction name of interest it appears in a fragment on line x fc d xt xt eq pc x febb f imacpc nil sp rp guardid xt is an appropriate name for a lir xt instruction xt appears again a couple of fragments later x fc d xt int i added some code to print the address of lir xt and lir int instructions and you can see it s the same address ie the memory has been recycled but the lirnamemap seemingly hasn t been recycled so xt is still associated with addres x fc d even thought the lir instruction at that location has changed and we use it inappropriately graydon you understand the allocator lifetimes any idea what s going on here the lirnamemap is using alloc as its allocator whereas the lirbuffer is using tempalloc i thought they should use the same one because the lifetime of a lir fragment should match the lifetime of its lirnamemap so i tried changing lirnamemap to use tempalloc but i got crashes and valgrind diagnoses bazillions of use after free errors then i tried changing lirbuffer to use alloc and the problem goes away but that extends the lirbuffer s lifetime inappropriately i think ,1

CORE-522245,in jetpack s test suite we use components utils forcegc in concert with components utils getweakreference to track objects of interest and ensure that unit functional tests don t have memory leaks this is intended to help find memory leaks in the underlying implementation we found though that when making weak references to dom objects like iframes cu forcegc didn t get rid of them but that the iframe would eventually disappear i realized a few days ago while learning about the cycle collector that this is due to the fact that cu forcegc is a simple wrapper for the jsapi s js gc which itself doesn t result in cycle collection in order for cycle collection to occur nscyclecollector collect needs to be called i can see two ways of enabling this modify cu forcegc to call nscyclecollector collect instead of js gc there s no need to additionally call js gc because performing cycle collection also performs standard mark and sweep gc ing add a new cu forcecc or cu forcecyclecollection function that calls nscyclecollector collect i d be happy to provide a patch for either just let me know which is preferred or if you have a better solution in mind ,1

NSPR-66325,this bug only affects hp ux on hp ux pr loadlibrary calls shl load with the dynamic path flag if an application is linked with the s linker option the dynamic path flag of shl load causes it to search for the shared library in some search path such as that specified by the shlib path environment variable however the way shl load dynamic path uses the search path is very aggressive for example if you have a libfoo sl on your shlib path all of the shl load calls below will succeed assuming none of the specified pathnames refer to an existing file shl load libfoo sl dynamic path bind deferred shl load libfoo sl dynamic path bind deferred shl load lib libfoo sl dynamic path bind deferred shl load no such dir libfoo sl dynamic path bind deferred shl load no such dir libfoo sl dynamic path bind deferred one would expect that only the first call should succeed i e the dynamic library search path should be used only when a plain file name containing no directory is specified indeed this is the behavior of dlopen we should modify pr loadlibrary to pass dynamic path to shl load only if the specified name is a plain file name containing no directory so that pr loadlibrary has the same behavior across all platforms ,0

CORE-397210,created attachment v this is a spin off of bug comment as the patch from bug comment shows it is desirable to store jstokenstream inside jsparsecontext yet jstokenstream already contains a pointer to jsparsecontext thus instead of using cross referenced jstokenstream and jsparsecontext i suggest to put jstokenstream into jsparsecontext as a field the attached patch implements this idea in the following way the patch removes jstokenstream dependency on a pointer to jsparsecontext the pointer was necessary only to call js newparsedobjectbox for a regex in the scanner with the patch the scanner delegates the creation of regex objects to the parser for clarity the patch also renames tok object into tok regexp the new code no longer allocates jstokenstream using jscontext temppool and replaces js new tokenstream functions via single inittokenstream it allowed to put jstokenstream directly into jsparsercontext as a field that in turn allowed to remove filename principals fields from jscodegenerator since they just contained copies of the values stored in jstokenstream the patch changes various js compile js parse functions to take jsparsecontext and rename js compiletokenstream into js compilescript for summetry with js compilefunctionbody the patch does not put jscontext into jsparsecontext to minimize the amount of changes delegating that and other potential cleanups to another bug ,0

CORE-317240,when i wrote the patch for bug i was assuming that there is only one relevant principal per xpcwrappednativescope the latter correspond to script global objects unfortunately the asserts i added in that patch fire indicating that this is not the case one obvious offender from looking at stacks is xmlhttprequest what happens there is that xmlhttprequest returns a new document object one that has its own principal based on the uri loaded via xmlhttprequest but there s only one scope around that of the caller since the xmlhttprequest document has no script global of its own hence the jsobject for that document has the caller as parent and that caller s principal may not be the same as the document s principal which triggers an assert now before the patch for bug what would happen is that for the xmlhttprequest document itself and for all nodes in it we d end up with the xmlhttprequest document s principal due to the precreate hook on the nodes but for various other objects return values of childnodes getelementsbytagname style etc we would end up with the calling scope as the principal for the newly created object i think this is only an issue for cases where a document has no scope of its own given that xpconnect uses the object we re working with as initial scope object for wrapping things but i m not sure in any case given the fact that the one scope one principal invariant doesn t hold what do we want to do we could back out bug that means we d still have issues for everything without a precreate hook but that might just be what we have to live with we could try to make this invariant hold which means that all documents would at least have their own xpconnect scope if not their own inner window that might be a pretty tough change though thoughts please feel free to cc others on this bug if i ve forgotten someone who might have an idea on this ,1

CORE-481753,after bug didn t solve the crash in mozilla central i went back to the source code with the ideas i found in that bug and found another this is a race condition load an image normally browsing happens and there are no more proxies for this image cache entry the image cache entry starts being tracked for removal the image is re requested and gets set up with its imgcacheentry again but does not get removed from the time based expiry notice imagelib needs to go out to the network to validate the cache entry enough time passes and the image cache entry is removed from the cache by the nsexpirytracker the validation results finally come back and the image needs to be re loaded the old image gets removed from the cache but wait it s already removed step is a bit iffy since the only stacks i ve ever seen for bug involve cancel i d expect a mix between cancel and the explicit removefromcache in imgcachevalidator unless it s really unusual for images to need to be re loaded when they re being validated i have no idea how to test this in a repeatable way ,0
CORE-388995,this bug is about ensuring that the showing and hiding of popups works without getting into a funky state i ve found a couple of issues while creating popup tests when menupopup onpopuphiding event preventdefault is used the popup is supposed to be prevented from being hidden that works but the popup then gets into a state where it can t be hidden if preventdefault isn t called on a later attempt to hide it or the popup can t be shown again also the event shouldn t be cancellable for content popups this is because for some reason i don t understand i wrote nsxulpopupmanager hidepopup to remove the popup from the open popups list before the popuphiding event when it should really be removed afterwards the is a popup open checks needs to be a bit better i think four states are needed closed showing open and hiding ,0

NSS-49316,from a customer i guess this is something between a bug report and a feature request but i m having a problem with the certutil exe tool as you my remember this tool manages certificates in a cert db certificate database the problem i ran into involves exporting a certificate from the database although the tool can generate a binary representation it has no way of writing that to a file using the redirect operator works fine for the ascii representation but since under the command shell in nt and i assume in all other windows all carriage return characters are replaced with cr lf pairs this does not work for the binary certificate i realize that i ll have to find a workaround for now but i thought perhaps you could direct this to the appropriate person to do something about it ,1

CORE-204545,while working on bug i first thought fixing the final case of memory leak would be a lot of work with lots of regression possibilities one idea was to not have listener members in the c interface itself but check if js had set those properties on the wrapper and call them when needed it turns out none of that is needed ie s similar object seems to clear it s event listeners at certain points after the first call has been sent one needs to call open set event listeners and call send in exactly that order to reuse the same object specifically if after first response you try to set event listeners call open send nothing will happen so it seems the second and subsequent open calls act as a kind of a reset you cannot check the values of event listeners on this object in ie i also noticed that if you try to do an asynchronous call without an event listener set nothing happens i propose that we should clear event listeners after receiving response which gets rid of the remaining reference cycle memory leak and brings us more on par with ie s implementation to get fully on par with ie we should refuse to set event listeners after the first response is received unless open has been called first i am not sure we should do this as it feels a bit like a bug in ie but i can not be sure in other words it might be like this for a valid reason i will point out this part of the fix in the comments of the patch ,0

SEAMONKEY-92947,i was reading sun s report on gnome usability specifically this page and found that after a few minutes some of the graphics had not been downloaded this problem also affects other pages where downloads of large amounts of graphics can lead to timing out of page element downloads the only way i knew the download had effectively stopped was by looking at my modem lights several years experience of the internet has taught me that if after two or three minutes of inactivity the action on a computer is likely to have been aborted even if the computer has not told me we need to tell the user that this is the case in mozilla the exact circumstances the user has begun downloading a web page that included external elements commonly graphics some pages are slow to download for a variety of reasons and some fail to load completely what the user thinks the user may have begun reading the page s content or interacting with it perhaps there are no immediate signs that the web browser has not completed it s downloading process or perhaps an error has occured which has failed to inform the user or not triggered an appropriate event in the software either way the user is either aware of the problem or not in both cases the user has had no direct feedback from mozilla what needs to happen mozilla needs to inform the user as to exactly what it s doing and if it has reached a conclusion tell the user in this case mozilla has completed downloading x y components on the page a simple counting process that isn t displayed and it is unknown what it is attempting to do now if the network connection for the remaining components has timed out or concluded in an error which is apparently the case then the status bar should notify the user appropriately a suggestion is made below document done x xxx secs page could not be fully downloaded this tells the user that the document was rendered as best as could be acheived but that parts of the page were not successfully downloaded once this or other appropriate message has been displayed the throbber should terminte animation the stop button should deactivate and the reload button should be re activatable this bug should only cover the case whereby a page could be displayed but not fully downloaded feedback given when a page tries to execute instructions in a script and is in error are similar but should be covered in a seperate bug cc gordon darin from networking component as code hooks will be needed remove from cc list as appropriate ,1

RELEASE_ENGINEERING-984923,our current prioritizebuilders functions has been causing us grief in a few ways it tries to assign work to only the most important builders usually only one or two at a time we ve had many cases where these builders can t assign work because their nextslave functions preclude any of the connected slaves from being used for example nextawsslave functions won t run a build on spot machines if there have been too many retries in the case we have only spot nodes connected and the most important builder has too many retries we end up in a case where no work is being assigned prioritizebuilders is returning only the most important builder and its nextslave returns none and nothing gets done this can cause massive delays for other builders that are also pending because pending jobs start piling up behind these stuck important builders that can t assign work aws watch pending tries to start more and more machines to service those requests eventually we end up starting all the machines including on demand nodes in the case described above this unplugs the stuck builder and then all the other pending requests can be serviced as well i d guess this makes this function one of our most expensive functions in the code base we should change this function to take into account the number of connected slaves and give other builders and chance to run as well some irc logs for more context bhearsum rail any thoughts on https github com catlee buildbot configs compare master branch priorities the idea is to be able to process as many builders as we have slaves while still preserving branch priorities catlee as opposed to all of the builders which is probably higher than the number of slaves bhearsum before it would pick just the most important builders bhearsum which could be just or of the set of pending bhearsum the problem we ve been seeing is that those or most important builders can t actually run on any of the available slaves catlee ah sorry getting distracted the problem the old function was trying to avoid was having slaves connect while the master is iterating through the sorted list of builders so before we d return the list of builders in sorted order if builder had no slaves we d move onto builder if a slave connected between then builder would get run even though builder is more important so then we changed it to return just the most important builders but returning just the most important builders fails when those builders can t assign work due to nextslave restrictions so i m thinking we should be able to safely consider as many builders as we have connected slaves seems fine but i feel like it still hasn t clicked in my head yet i ll come back to it after this release stuff calms down sure catlee i guess my only question is why not return all of the builders instead of just len connected slaves bhearsum in the case we have no connected slaves buildbot will process builders in order that processing happens in a bit of an async loop so slaves can connect in between builders being processed so the most important builder can be skipped because there are no slaves available at the time and then a slave connects and a less important builder gets it catlee how does that work when we re just returning a subset of all of the builders then i m not sure if it was clear but i was suggesting returning all of the builders sorted bhearsum right i m trying to explain why returning all the builders sorted doesn t work catlee but returning a subset of those builders sorted works bhearsum rereads everything t sort builders into b b b return b b b no slaves connected t look at b no slaves move on t slave s connects t look at b give job to s right i understand that bug ok so that s what happens if you return all the builders sorted doesn t that happen if you return b b in your scenario too hopefully not because i know we have slaves so i ll return b b if we only have slave i ll return b anyway that s my idea for improving things right now we return just b no matter how many slaves we have yeah that s clearly silly and sometimes b can t run so what happens if we return b b but both slaves that are free are jacuzzi ed to b which also has pending we are taking into account jacuzzis i think oh right just not in the context of this diff right we ve already filtered our slaves down right ok so its cases like nextawsslave that forces things to run on spot not spot one more question you mentioned above that sometimes builders can t actually run on any of the available slaves does that mean those builders don t have those slaves in their list or something else something else nextslave prevents it from running on a connected slave ah e g we have only spot connected but the builder has retries so we want to run on ondemand so nextslave returns none this is what s causing some of our spikes i think b is pending so we re spinning up machines for it but it can t run on any of the machines meanwhile b b are piling up so could we still hit this in a case where we return b b but the slaves get rejected by nextslave but b never gets tried because prioritizebuilders won t return it until b or b starts but they re not getting a chance to take jobs yeah that makes sense i think i have a full grasp of the problem now yeah we could still hit it but presumably we ll cycle fast enough that it ll be much rarer hopefully well part of this is a failure to spin up the right instances for jobs but this change should give other builders a chance more of a chance than they have now anyway i suppose there s no way to invalidate and rerun prioritizebuilders when a slave connects mid iteration through builders yeah it definitely sounds like a big improvement not really no i was thinking maybe some caching could help like if we re looking at the same builders with same set of slaves then do something different or perhaps claling nextslave from here too but that sounds expensive yeah it s a mismatch between nextslave prioritizebuilders and watch pending well i m fine with landing this a comment about the situation where you don t start b because of nextslave rejects would be useful though i think catlee thanks for all the hand holding here bhearsum thanks for digging into it in the glorious future it seems like it would be nice to have prioritizebuilders and nextslave closer together or maybe the same code it s good to have more people to blame w w understand this hey don t you be putting me as the author here qrefresh u ftw qrefresh fu p,0

NSS-301259,the signtool documentation that once existed on developer netscape com is now all gone all we have left is the usage message in the tool itself and that is very unhelpful the usage message cites non existant urls for documentation and it gives examples that use otherwise undocumented options as modifiers today one cannot even determine the distinct operations that the tool can perform from the usage message this needs urgent attention the usage message needs to document every option known to signtool separate the command options which specify the operation to be performed from the modifier options that merely supply file names or info about variants on how to perform the operation document which options are required for each operation e g cert nickname is likely required for signing but not for jar signature verification the usage message should not cite urls from netscape com any longer after reading the usage message the reader should easily be able to list the operations that the tool can perform know which options are required for each of those operations the existing usage message states that every command requires a positional parameter which is a directory tree but the v and w commands take an an argument that is a jar file name not a directory tree name so that usage summary is wrong if there are any commands that can operate from either a jar file or a directory tree or both as input this needs to be documented in the usage somehow along with how to specify one or the other and which is default likewise for output some commands produce a jar file as output they may also leave a modified directory tree as output the production of the output jar file may be optional the usage needs to make this clear finally i will add that after reading the usage the reader should be able to answer the question of which command cause any jar file contents to be uncompressed and extracted ,1

BUGZILLA-105960,because xml cgi basically hand crafts xml instead of using the standard perl xml libraries it doesn t escape encode umlauts for example so the xml it creates is invalid this means that sane xml libraries looking to parse the code are well displeased because we are moving towards templates for all data output not just xml cgi it seems unlikely that this problem is going to be solved the correct way i e by using the perl xml libraries to create properly encoded xml so i m not entirely sure that there is any elegant solution to this except maybe to provide a encode this like xml likes function that can be called iff xml is chosen as the output format not sure how that would work though but it is a problem and will continue to be if people want to use standard system libraries on both linux and windows to create interaction with bugzilla ,1

CORE-919144,css properties that need to set properties on layers fall into two categories those that force their element to be a stacking context and those that don t the former case is relatively easy to handle nsframe builddisplaylistforchild recognizes the property as creating a stacking context and calls nsframe builddisplaylistforstackingcontext which then creates a display item which returns something other than layer none from nsdisplayitem getlayerstate and builds a layer with the right properties set on it in nsdisplayitem buildlayer the element being a stacking context means all its descendant content can be rendered as the children of a single display item the latter case is difficult to handle because the element s descendants may be interleaved in z order with other content that is not affected by the css property so multiple layers must be modified for a given css property on a given element for position fixed we tried to handle this by creating multiple nsdisplayfixedposition display items and later opportunistically merging them this turns out to be a real pain for lots of reasons for example it complicates invalidation and it s complex to make sure that the right display items are created and merged it also interacts poorly with our invariant that display item frame key pairs are unique we already have a better way to handle the latter case and we use it for scrolling framelayerbuilder calls nslayoututils getactivescrolledroot on the frame for every display item to figure out what the nearest scrolling ancestor is and display items are clustered into thebeslayers so that all the items in a given thebeslayer have the same active scrolled root each thebeslayer is given a transform based on the scroll position of the active scrolled root for its items in bug and bug i extend that so that elements with animated top left right bottom and margins are also considered active scrolled roots and it works beautifully and simply i think we can keep extending this approach to handle position fixed touch action and other properties that don t create stacking contexts here s how it looks getactivescrolledroot is generalized to compute for each display item a key tuple of the values that will determine properties of its thebeslayer the members of this tuple will be the nearest geometric ancestor frame that is being scrolled or having its position animated or is position fixed a boolean indicating whether the display item should trigger default panning behavior when touched other fields can be added as needed items with different key tuples are forced into different layers thus all items in a thebeslayer have the same key tuple framelayerbuilder is responsible for assigning layer properties to thebeslayers and other layers based on the key tuple these properties include a layer transform fixed positioning properties and some new property for touch action the first thing to do here is to rework nsdisplayfixedposition to basically get rid of the display item and generalize getactivescrolledroot instead ,1

RHINO_GRAVEYARD-201893,steven beal wrote to me some time ago original message subject rhino performance tip faq recommendation date fri feb from steven beal to igor bukanov e mail igor i was experiencing poor performance on the ibm virtual machine the one shipped with websphere and eventually traced the problem to excessive throwing and catching of exceptions the sun vm handles exceptions much more efficiently and thus does not suffer quite so much from exceptions being thrown and caught in quick succession which is why i didn t notice the issue before this is not a bug in rhino in fact the condition is produced by a workaround for a sun java bug http developer java sun com developer bugparade bugs html see org mozilla javascript nativejavamethod retryillegalaccessinvoke the pattern used here is the same as that shown in one of the annotations of the currently open incarnation of the same bug http developer java sun com developer bugparade bugs html this bug is not limited to inner classes though it will also manifest itself why trying to invoke via reflection a method on a pkg private class offered via an interface i place several references into the local scope created for a request that are interface references to pkg private classes created via an abstract factory pattern by making these classes public i avoided the need for the bug workaround and improved performance significantly a necessary compromise perhaps some mention of this should be made in the faq since the performance impact is significant extremely so on the ibm vm the same problem would be seen when using dynamic proxies and features of the collection classes if you read through the associated bug reports i m sure you will find more cases regards steve,1

CORE_GRAVEYARD-293571,well i think that the summary is right i guess allan will have to tell us if i ve gotten on the wrong track if i bind an output to instance data element using value values value the output control won t be refreshed if we do a xf setvalue with value values value however if we change both expressions to be values value then it will refresh fine output elements don t end up with a mboundnode since it calls resetboundnode with type nsidomxpathresult string type instead of evaluating for a node when it detects value w o other binding attributes so the output control will depend on the xpath dependencies that come back during the call to nsxformsxpathanalyzer analyze called during node binding to detect when to rebind and refresh when nsxformsmodelelement revalidate is called a dependency node is found when values value is evaluated but not when values value is called so that output control won t detect that it needs to be refreshed after set value changes the instance node i think that i remember problems with output not refreshing correctly if bound solely with value but i couldn t find an open bug that seemed to match this ,1

CORE-447866,user agent mozilla x u linux x en us rv gecko firefox build identifier fennec m i have observed that when fetching a page with max connection of i would never see pipelining while the base html document was being transferred i thought for a bit this was speculative loader but it applies in the case of javascript as well as images et al and that bug does not apply to fetching js furthermore if i have connections the javascript is indeed fetched in parallel with the html page so it is not a case of not scheduling the transaction it just won t pipeline it if a free connection is unavailable this generalizes to any case needing n objects over n connections the first n go in parallel but no pipelining occurs until one of those first connections frees up but i do see pipelining just never against the first transaction on a connection which brings me to the meat of this issue i ve dug around and i m looking for clarifications on what i think is going on roughly speaking new transactions come into nshttpconnectionmgr processnewtransaction and the manager tries to find a connection for them to use this might be an idle persistent connection or it might be a new tcp session this allocation is subject to per server and ua wide limits if it finds a connection the http request is dispatched to that connection and sent right out if it can t find one probably due to those limits the transaction is put on the pending queue in memory when a connection finishes its scheduled work it goes through the reclaim logic and then a new transaction is plucked from the pending queue if any and dispatched again either reusing that connection in the case of persistent conns or using a new connection pipelining is cleverly wedged in here through the dispatch logic which basically says when sending its request if there are more transactions queued up subject to pipelining suitability of course then add some of those transactions up to the number allowed by the maxpipelinedrequests preference to this connection too when the connection is activated there may be multiple requests written out all at the same time in a pipelined burst this means that requests are never pipelined at the rate they are identifed to processnewtransaction pnt always sends them out right way or adds latency by placing the in pending queue the reclaim logic then grabs as many as it is allowed from the queue the next time around and sends them out in a burst this creates a couple problems the aforementioned problem where the first transaction on an idle connection dispatched directly from pnt never has anything pipelined against it and this likely includes key components such as js and css against base html the burstiness of the request bundling leads to additional transfer latency as upstream bandwidth could be exhausted and network queuing delays kick in especially true on mobile where upstream bandwidths can be stingy at best burstiness will also interfere with any strategies we may want to implement to manage the windows on different connections to dynamically balance their priorities right now the flow looks like out in where it could look like out in the latter finishes quicker and is smoother both desirable properties i don t have enough of a handle on the code yet to even suggest how to fix it it certainly looks like connection activate wants to have everything queued on it and then run to completion before having new transactions enqueued but i m sure its not a huge deal reproducible always,1

OTHER_APPLICATIONS-315913,this is mainly a personal rant because i ve only just written the patch so i haven t had time to profile it properly but i get the feeling that chatzilla spends too much time sorting the nick list this is particularly evident when an op pings out what tends to happen is that you get join auto op part and nick changes in quick succession which seems to kill my cpu the main thrust of my proposal is changing the tree from a content view to a builder view achieved by setting flags dont build content on the tree this already allows us to automatically sort when switching channel or when new nicks join a channel the sort order is initialized once and then the tree maintains its sort although this can of course be toggled nick and op changes in sort by op mode are handled by removing and reinserting the nick calls to updateuserlist are therefore removed in setcurrentobject my cjoin my cmode and my cnick although in the latter two cases calls to removeuserfromgraph and addusertograph are used to maintain the nick list i changed setlistmode to clear the tree cache directly it appeared to be relying on some unknown side effect for its attribute change to take effect the only other change necessary in the current code was the code that extracts the nick from a given tree row as the builder view does not permit arbitrary attributes i had to extract the unicode name from the rdf data source however the reverse operation of obtaining the tree row from a nick is simplified to tree builderview getindexofresource nick getgraphresource i m not sure what style is preferred so i tested for nsitreecolumn in my new sortuserlist method although i have only tested it on so far ,1

control the heap layout it is possible to execute arbitrary code here is some details on how to exploit the bug on linux use a javascript and allocate a lot of local buffer i found jc gc is called at the end of the javascript parsing before any image are loaded and will free all useless because local buffer thus it is easy to allocate in some global array a lot of little bufer to begin so we have the heap layout in a predictable state no hole allocate a few big buffer with isdigit valid character because there is no more heap hole the top chunk of the heap is expended when jc gc return some memory have been freed and thus following allocation will fall in these new heap hole when the image is processed the overflowed buffer will be followed by isdigit character this is junk in the prev size field of the next struct malloc chunk then a will be written on the lsb of the next size field of the next struct malloc chunk on the heap because it is easily possible to inject controlled character on the heap actually that could have been done in the few isdigit valid buffer it is possible to store fake information on the heap and tricks malloc free etc to parse them still in the scheme of doug lea malloc linux this will end by triggering the macro unlink which basically insert a heap chunk in a linked list thus writing a controlled pointer of us to a controlled address of us one can simply overwrite any function pointer like got entry saved eip pointer on the stack and hijack it to point to some injected shellcode exploitation is possible on bsd windows aswell actual results ability to execute whatever code you want expected results stop me ,0

CORE-232567,mozilla needs to remove all support for username and password authentication in the url from http https and http with ssl this problematic feature allows urls in the form of http username password example com currently when mozilla gets that url it takes the user to example com and logs the user in as username with password unfortunately this can be exploited indeed it has grown increasingly common that urls in the form of http username password example com are creating large security problems take this example http www mozilla org item dq d h nf dhdfjk jk d djk example com bad evil fraud identitytheft following that url a user might think he is going to the friendly confines of mozilla org unfortunately he ends up at the unfriendly confines of http example com bad evil fraud identitytheft this feature is being used today to harm and exploit our users we have to respond mozilla has made improvements in our handling of these urls further improvements are on the drawing board neverthless any improvements ultimately cannot raise our level of security high enough we can try to fashion a dialog box or even highlight the url in an eye catching manner user education must accompany any such enhancement of course the internet will always have many new inexperienced and uneducated users even experienced users sometimes click on the wrong urls by accident therefore it is inevitable that many mozilla users will be exploited by this feature no matter how we improve on it the only way to really solve the problem once and for all is to rip out url authentication altogether rfc may indeed require that an http s implementation like mozilla honor url authentication http www faqs org rfcs rfc html allowing these kinds of urls was fine a few years ago today however it creates a security hole ever more commonly exploited the mozilla project does need to honor standards yet when the purpose of a certain standard is no longer relevant or is outweighed by other concerns such as security then we have to react to the changing real world conditions today the cost of supporting this feature far outweighs the benefit by removing this feature we will fix a major security hole for good microsoft has announced it will remove support for these urls http support microsoft com default aspx scid kb ln since msie currently has an market share most sites that make use of this feature will soon give it up thus when mozilla follows suit and removes the feature our userbase will not be terribly aggrieved neither ftp nor any other protocol is affected by this bug report ,1

MAILNEWS_CORE-409259,user agent mozilla windows u windows nt en us rv gecko firefox build identifier there is apparently an internal default timeout in thunderbird for imap operations after seconds if any particular imap operation has not completed thunderbird simply drops the imap connection re opens another one and immediately issues the same command again this is very bad behaviour on numerous counts i m not sure if the particular timeout encountered here is listed on this site but it might be http kb mozillazine org modify thunderbird settings for example one customer of ours is testing deleting large numbers of messages thunderbird by default does a message delete by actually copying the message to the trash folder then setting the delete flag on the messages in the original folder for example the inbox in doing this it is issuing imap copy instructions on a large range of messages in a single operation the imap protocol does not allow for any processing response mid transaction in this only ok no or bad upon completion termination of the operation if these operations take more than seconds to complete thunderbird simply gives up and issues the same command again over and over as the server may not even now at this point that the connection is dropped it may actually have multiple simultaneous copy or append operations initiated following is an example from a communigate pro log for a copy of messages to the mailbox inbox testmailbox notice the minute intervals imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox imap inp uid copy inbox testmailbox there are probably a few recommended behavioural changes here imap has no timeouts defined at all in the protocol http www faqs org rfcs rfc html it would probably be better more correct to use timeouts only at the tcp level and not at the imap application layer since there is no support in imap to notify either party server client of timing if you really think that timeouts are needed the default ones should be increased significantly minutes or longer at a minimum however logically there will always be some operation which could be issued which would exceed whatever timeout was set imap copy or append operations can be very resource expensive and time consuming for obvious reasons modern mailboxes may be many gbs in size if a timeout is signaled the client should not simply issue the same command again as it can only make server performance degrade in this scenario it might be better if thunderbird performed a copy operation instead on each message rather than on ranges of messages this would increase the number of transactions but would ensure that each operation was acknowledged individually and would allow thunderbird to display to progression of messages being moved to the destination mailbox reproducible always steps to reproduce create a very large mailbox one in which performing an imap copy or append will take longer than seconds on the server to complete copy the messages in this mailbox to another mailbox or alternately just use the thunderbird delete operation which by default copies the messages to the trash mailbox in most cases the operation will never complete or thunderbird will lock up freeze actual results operation never completes successfully and the command may be automatically repeated indefinitely by thunderbird thereby potentially greatly increasing the load on the imap server expected results the imap copy or append should complete eventually this bug is probably related to many others i found in the database though none exactly laying out the underlying problem which is that the imap protocol does not provide for timeouts or mid transaction dialog therefore these timeouts should probably be removed from thunderbird here are some other bugs likely related https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id https bugzilla mozilla org show bug cgi id another optimization that could be made in this area though with more discussion really needed because of the change in behaviour is that the trash mailbox should really be a virtual mailbox listing all of those messages marked delete without actually having to perform an imap copy operation to a real mailbox called trash this is highly inefficient as a default behaviour note some users may prefer to have an actual trash mailbox as a storage space so this behaviour could be retained as an option thank you very much please feel free to let me know if you have any questions or need more information ,1

FIREFOX_GRAVEYARD-368252,in order to better enable extensions and core code to extend microsummary functionality it would be useful to broadcast a notification via the observer service most likely when a live title gets updated so that extensions can do additional work at that point for example an extension could use this to flash the live title or otherwise f e using growl bring the update to the attention of the user and an extension that allows users to specify refresh intervals for individual live titles might then modify the live title s expiration time from the default assigned by the microsummary service one question is whether it would make sense to additionally notify observers before initiating the update request and giving them the opportunity to cancel or otherwise modify it i e something like a microsummary before update notification in addition to a microsummary after update one another issue is what to pass in the asubject and somedata parameters to nsiobserverservice notifyobservers currently an nsimicrosummary has no knowledge about the live title it s being used for if any so just passing it as the value of the asubject parameter doesn t give the observer enough information we could additionally pass the bookmark id as the value of somedata but that seems clunky seems like we re going to have to either make nsimicrosummary smarter about what it s being used for bookmark label page tab label etc or pass some other object referencing both the nsimicrosummary and the thing using it nsimicrosummaryconsumer there may be additional notifications that it would be useful to broadcast but let s focus this bug on this particular one or two which has clear utility and use separate bugs for other potentially useful notifications ,1

CORE-123049,not sure exactly who to give this to so i m cc ing some layout heavy hitters and assigning it to myself this bug was originally reported as bug composer crashes when loading pages with an html select element framemanager getprimaryframefor for which i checked in a work around the basic problem is that nsstylechangelist appendchange does not deal with the fact that anonymous frames can point to either an anonymous content node or the content node for a parent frame should two or more sibling anonymous content frames require a frame change we can get into trouble if we push an anonymous content node on the changelist and then push the parent content node on the list as the result of a sibling frame who s content pointer pointed to the parent content node nscssframeconstructor processrestyledframes processes the changelist backwards which means it would process the parent content node first so as a result we end up blowing away the entire frame hierarchy including the anonymous content frames and all their anonymous content leaving deleted nodes in the change list that will be processed when they do get processed we usually crash some place like getprimaryframefor i ll attatch a js test case that demostrates this crash rather easily in the browser and viewer it s probably a good idea to read over the comments dbaron and i made in bug for more details a stack trace for the crash looks something like this framemanager getprimaryframefor framemanager const x d e nsicontent x ab b nsiframe x ccec line bytes presshell getprimaryframefor
