EVOLUTION-DATA-SERVER-750427,this is a follow up from gnome online accounts bug https bugzilla gnome org show bug cgi id in our exchange environment the ews server is running at mail foo com real name masked when i try to add the account using gnome control center gnome online accounts i have to use the servername foo com instead of mail foo com to make the autodiscovery work correctly and allow the account to be configured correctly when i start evolution after the account is added then evolution sees the new account as expected but it fails to connect to it this appears due to evolution trying to connect to the server foo com instead of mail foo com the autodiscover response from the ews server the request for this was done by goa internally contains this data https mail foo com ews exchange asmx https mail foo com ews exchange asmx https owa foo com ecp the autodiscover server for this exchange environment is running at autodiscover foo com i would expect evolution to also try to look up the exact server name based on a autodiscover request instead of using the exact same servername as configured in gnome control center goa ,0

NAUTILUS-45440,as i reduce the width of my nautilus window while viewing my home directory i am seeing a horizontal scrollbar right before the width is small enough to reduce the column count i m unable to generalize it enough to the point of long filenames being the cause but i suspect that may be involved my home directory on eazel s internal network h brett is readable and displays this problem every time starting with nautilus in icon view at h brett and showing columns layout by name slowly reduce the width of the nautilus window so columns get removed and the view is redrawn watch for the horizontal scrollbars that appear right before each column is removed my expectation is that if a horizontal scrollbar is needed it should actually result in column removal for reference see also bug regarding icon view wrapping too soon and bug regarding tighter layout using horizontal scrollbars also additional comments from darin bentspoon com i believe the scrollbars appear for a moment before the view is layed out to fit the new size it would be even better if they didn t appear at all additional comments from sullivan eazel com i think this was fixed when bug was fixed bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

BONOBO-81913,makefile am in the storage modules subdirectory specifies lefs in a module s ldflags this is wrong as it essentially requires libefs la to present in the default library directories at the moment when make install is performed in the subdirectory although libefs is built and installed from the same source distribution for distribution builds with a custom destdir value this fails in a subtle manner if a system libefs la is not present ,1
METACITY-104023,the two snippets below amount to a problem when we get a net close we attempt to send a net wm ping to the window with timestamp currenttime but meta display ping window doesn t allow this because currenttime is no good for uniquely identifying pongs i ll attach a test app to play around with the various behaviours that metacity handles when closing a window i think the wm spec should maybe put a time in this message currenttime here is sort of bogus but it rarely matters most likely meta window delete window meta display get current time window display if timestamp currenttime meta warning tried to ping a window with currenttime not allowed n return ,1

GNOME-CALCULATOR-304056,this bug has been opened here https bugzilla ubuntu com this bug may be needed to be moved upstream when a user enters a statement with exponentiation using the keyboard instead of seeing the proper in the statement they will have entered in xor example entered with the keyboard will become and be calculated as xor i m not so sure that many developers find this handy and for myself and the average user should be exponentiation not an exclusive or there seems to be no other sane keycode for entering in exponentiation from the keyboard even tosses up a malformed statement error this interpretation of the keycode needs to be changed into the nicely sane default of exponentiation the default shortcut for exponentiation is y as in x y https bugzilla ubuntu com attachment cgi id calc xpowy and x calc xor ah there we go it seems that this is a simple three line patch to lr parser y i ran the old ask people usability test on what button people use when they plug expressions into their software calculators and it s either i use a mouse or i hit that carrot hat up arrow button maybe it s a cultural thing but so far no one has thought that y would be something they would try i m including a patch to switch to calc xpowy and x to calc xor i ve triple checked to make sure this doesn t break anything in the parser feeling silly for making a new patch and a new comment for three lines of work on such a trivial change the patch is against the latest cvs but i doubt the parser has changed much in case someone goes crazy should not be used as the new keycode for exponentiation for a variety of reasons the most basic of these is that does not exist as an operator for most users and mathematicians unless they happen to be doing some numerical analysis ,0

EVOLUTION-256919, gnome icon theme includes a special icon called stock calendar and tasks png general http primates ximian com jimmac product design evolution screenshots calendar an tasks general png spacing frame style and capitalization needs fixing some mnemonics are missing and some are conflicting the mockup above doesn t have a mnemonic to acces the minutes hours days dropdown before every appointment should be good in case the work days take too much horizontal space it may be possible to split sat and sun and have them in a new row ask for confirmation is not real an alert that s why i suggest moving it to a separate group also we may want to stop using the terms alert and reminder when we refer to the same thing day begins and day ends fields have been put to separate rows since they make the dialog too wide display http primates ximian com jimmac product design evolution screenshots cat display png the last set of controls hiding completed tasks is problematic since it doesn t allow access using mnemonics but at this point i don t have a better suggestion free busy publishing the main dialog keeps the consistent layout seen elsewhere however i suggest aligning the button to the top edge to align with the list gtktreeview i suggest dropping the enable disable button since the check box toggle alone seems obvious and it s confusing the button changes it s label without being a toggle button bug http primates ximian com jimmac product design evolution screenshots freebusy png the new edit dialog does not yet follow the hig because the dialog was very tall i suggest merging the free busy location with publishing frequency and using a drop down instead of radio boxes also i suggest changing user publishes to custom the published calendars frame currently lists all calendar sources including contacts and on the web it may be appropriate to leave out web sources if technically doable ,1

EVOLUTION-339626,in some places the wrong icon is being used as a trash icon as the stock delete icons in gtk are trash cans but this is not true in all themes the attached patches fixes the ui to do the following remove the undelete icon from the menu item it is not in the toolbar update several icons that were using gtk stock delete to use the gnome trash icons we probably should also change delete to move to trash in the menus but i think this can wait as it breaks string freeze however doing this will improve the consistency with nautilus and also more directly show the behavior of deleting mail delete folder should still use the delete icon as it is actually non recoverable ,0

GTK+-457118,when switching to and from fullscreen mode the cursor is offset from the point where any tool is actually used paint marquee blur paths etc it goes like this when the cursor is working properly in fullscreen mode and i switch to windowed mode the cursor is now offset to the upper left by a few inches when the cursor works properly in windowed mode and i switch to fullscreen the cursor is offset the same distance to the lower right to replicate this problem create or open a file press f to go to fullscreen at that point it is apparent the cursor is in the wrong place to get the cursor where it should be i have to hover it over a menu status bar or other non canvas surface and then it is in the right position this is a suitable solution for now note that if you use the menu view fullscreen button the cursor will still be in the right place in fullscreen this bug only happens when i use the f shortcut or the esc key to leave fullscreen mode i see no reference to this problem anywhere so it could be that somehow i screwed up things on my own side so unless someone else can duplicate this i wouldn t bother looking for why its happening chris,1

GLIB-59659,the two calls g filename to uri and g filename from uri were added to make it easy to manipulate uris in drag and drop code for moving and copying files unfortunately they do not provide a simple interface to what s needed in such code the receiving end needs to not only parse out the filename and host from the uri but also check that the host is either null localhost or a name for the local host the sending end needs to not only make a uri out of the filename but also encode the name for the local host we need convenience functions for both of these for gnome if we don t have them in glib we ll have to put them in some other gnome platform library or worse we ll have to put them multiple places perhaps in eel for instance i guess it s too late to do anything about this for glib bummer ,1

METACITY-98119,i like to keep galeon open in fullscreen mode on it s own workspace but if a gaim window pops up while i m on that workspace i never see it if i put gaim on all workspaces i can alt tab to it but all i ever see is the outline of the window when i release alt tab the outline disappears without presenting the gaim window the only way to expose the other windows is to move out of fullscreen mode it s hard to say what the correct behavior should be maybe fullscreen windows should be treated as their own workspaces where only transients of that window can cohabitate ,0

GDM-56654, daemon slave c c format msgid gdm slave greeter couldn t set groupid to d there are a lot of this type of messages in gdm the problem is that the first part gdm slave greeter in this case is a string that should not be translated but still it is part of a message that is marked for translation this gives several problems first of all messages marked for translation should ideally only contain strings that is intended to be translated this is cleaner for the translators and also helps translators avoid mistakes second the not to be translated reference adds unnecessary uniqueness to the message and prevents translator tools like msgmerge and translation memory tools to be able to properly reuse existing similar translations for example the example message above is unnecessary duplicated if it had been written s couldn t set groupid to d in fprintf style with s replacing the reference both these current messages in gdm would automatically be replaced by one in the po files reducing the workload for translators i suggest all these gdm foo bar messages be rewritten similar to the above thanks ,1

NAUTILUS-41994,for example ftp ftp gnome org md sums txt additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org i meant ftp gnu org not ftp gnome org additional comments from darin bentspoon com why is it blocking the nautilus api this is the next step in fuguring out how hard it is to fix this bug perhaps there s code that s doing sync i o instead of async in nautilus itself that needs to be fixed i know there are at least some cases like this perhaps our design requires that the view components also do all their i o async and the problem is with the bonobo plain text control additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org i suspect the nautilus gnome vfs based bonobo stream implementation is doing sync i o not sure how hard it is to fix being generous for the moment additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org this is a deep architecture issue here the bonobo stream interface is synchronous which makes it fundamentally impossible to avoid having components block the nautilus ui raising time estimate to include the time it will take to fix this in bonobo and the world in a satisfactory way additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org i thought of a better way to do this that i discussed with darin which is to have another component act as a proxy for controls and embeddables i think with this other design it s possible to finish in only one week and as a side effect it will simplify the nautilus core additional comments from sullivan eazel com setting all bugs to p to start official bug prioritization plan please don t set the priority to anything other than p unless you ve got the gold seal of approval for doing so additional comments from will lashell net i wasn t sure what to do about this one ftp browsing doesn t seem to be that slow but you can t open a file at all it generates the following error gtk critical file gtkprogress c line gtk progress set percentage assertion percentage percentage failed it happens when you try to view any and all files with nautilus on any ftp server i tried a backtrace and more info available if needed it should be pretty reproducible additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org i get this error too but it s a bonobo bug that i unfortunately cannot fix right now additional comments from eli eazel com batch assigning qa ownership of remaining bugs to eli eazel com bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

GSTREAMER-460422,hi the attached patch adds support for float and double output in audiotestsrc apart from weird clipping with audiotestsrc audioconvert alsasink everything seems to be fine not sure what the clipping causes when writing the sound to a file all samples look fine but are going over the full range of possible values instead of keeping a bit space around the borders lowering the volume of audiotestsrc also helps output to int and then converting to int works too so no idea using osssink instead does work too so maybe alsa simply can t cope with values going over the complete bit range bye,0

GSTREAMER-637300,we should add new api to core to make requesting pads based on caps possible dynamically the normal way doesn t work for encodebin because it has quasi dynamic pad templates that depend on the configured encoding profile but pad templates can t actually be dynamic and so in encodebin s case they only have any caps on them which means that code that wants to create a request pad for certain caps can t just iterate the templates and intersect to find the right template wim suggested just creating a new template and setting the desired caps on that and passing that to the request pad vfunc implementation but i don t know of any request pad new implementations that expect such behaviour and don t assume that the pad template is one of the ones it set up before the easiest way would be to just create a new function vfunc with an additional gstcaps argument and maybe deprecate the old one alternatively one could go for just adding a new func vfunc with direction caps since template name are most likely not of interest in this use case ,0

EVOLUTION-522153,this bug tracks phase of my composer rewrite for evolution see for more details i believe the new gtkhtml editor component is far enough along to be included in trunk for evolution evolution integration is progressing and i hope to have it ready as well in time for or details the primary goal of the composer rewrite is to eliminate gtkhtml s dependence on libbonobo and libbonoboui by providing an html editor in the form of a gtkwindow rather than a bonobocomponent although phase is a complete rewrite of the html editor the new editor should look and behave like the old editor as much as possible ideally users should not notice any difference the new editor eliminates gtkhtml s dependence on gnomespell another bonobocomponent opting instead to interface directly with libenchant with help from iso codes for translated language names it implements gnomespell s spell checking ui natively the new editor s menus and toolbars can be extended using gtkuimanager this is critical for evolution s mail composer the new editor can be installed in parallel with the current bonobo based editor a new with bonobo editor configure option determines whether to build the older bonobo based editor for now it defaults to yes once the evolution integration is complete and committed to trunk i plan to change the default to no evolution is the only known consumer of gtkhtml s editor component http www go evolution org new composer,1

GTHUMB-453893,i think the following happens the program tries to generate previews for the raw files which go askew the preview is split horizontally the top half displays the jpg stored inside the exif the bottom half is a preview of the raw file itself if i try to browse a directory containing s raw files mb the gthumb takes a large amount of resources eventually it looks like gthumb crashed but after a minutes it manages to process the complete directory and displays the split screen previews the best solution would be to use the exif preview because it is a high resolution preview and the raw file is not properly processed it is most of the time way to dark when i use high dynamic range please let me know if i can provide screen shots or provide a raw file for testing debugging ,0

GNUCASH-514043,am cflags is passed both to the compiler c o and to the linker so it should only have flags that are appropriate for both steps am cppflags is passed only to the compiler so flags that are only appropriate for that step i and d flags for example should be in cppflags instead of cflags every gnucash makefile am that passes i flags gets it wrong placing them in cflags it s not a functional bug the linker ignores i flags but a ton of superfluous flags makes the build output pretty verbose and hard to debug when things do go wrong to make matters more confusing as a developer the foo cflags variable set by pkg check modules foo is actually for cppflags in the makefile am pkg config cflags returns the i flags a related i bug one that is functionally broken is that sometimes a local build dir i flag is passed after a global installed dependent library one if my system happens to have a header installed from some unrelated thing compiler will find that one instead of the expected one in the source directory should always pass all local i before any global ones let me know if you want a mega patch for all this ,1

GSTREAMER-350723,this may be the cause bug but i am not sure about this so i am opening a new bug this bug was resolved and fixed by martin zlomek martin zlomek itonis tv there is a bug in mad plugin caused by curious behaviour of libmad the plugin joins incoming buffers to a temporary buffer in its chain function when an incoming buffer has a valid timestamp input timestamp the plugin uses it for timestamping of the outgoing buffer output timestamp otherwise interpolates the output timestamp from the previous input timestamp and the number of samples decoded the activation of the new input timestamp is postponed if any data remains in the temporary buffer from the previous iteration of the chain function the libmad decodes the data frame after frame there is a check in the libmad call if the input buffer i e the temporary buffer has enough data if the input buffer has not required amount of data libmad call fails and the chain function returns to gather more data in the next iteration the libmad call requires frame size mad buffer guard bytes of input data the problem occurs when the input buffer has just between frame size and frame size mad buffer guard bytes in the next interation of the chain function if the incoming buffer has a valid timestamp then this timestamp is used just after decoding of the first frame frame size bytes from the temporary buffer this causes the timestamp hole the input timestamp is activated too early because there is another frame which begins in the previous iteration it has mad buffer guard bytes from the prev iter and should have output timestamp interpolated still from the previous input timestamp on the other hand because of the hole there are duplicated timestamps a few frames later included patch fixes this bug it waits with the activation untill the second frame is decoded it also fixes dropping of the exactly first frame of the whole decoding when the plugin is detecting mp see the block containing mpg parse xing header ,0

GYRUS-337655,from gyrus list gnome org hi while testing gyrus which is really a nice utility i found a bug in function gyrus admin login in file gyrus admin c the problem occurs if a user tries to login to the imap server using a password which contains white space characters like ascii x which is perfectly valid according to rfc and rfc such a password has to be a literal string or quoted string though and the quotes are missing in the gyrus sources as of version i m attaching a patch which solves the problem by providing double quote characters around the password tested with gyrus please note with the patch it is still not possible to send passwords containing double quote characters it might be better to use literal strings as defined in rfc though this might make handling of the login command a little bit complicated as the client has to wait for the server command continuation request after sending the initial nnn crlf sequence note also that the same is true for the userid field of the login command hth andreas ps i found gyrus error message unable to connect with empty passwords please introduce your password very misleading as the problem occured after entering a valid password ,1

EVOLUTION-349573,please describe the problem i am a developer for cosmo a caldav server some of our users have reported that evolution is unable to delete events from their caldav calendars it appears that when evolution sends a delete for an event resource it includes an if none match header taken from an example request trace delete cosmo home lcd scooby t z ics http host if none match authorization basic bgnkonnlehnlea user agent evolution i dunno what s up with that user agent header i didn t get this trace output myself the user says he s using evolution as per the http spec cosmo matches the etag specified in the if none match header to the current etag of the resource in question when it finds that the etags match it returns a precondition failed to the user the delete operation apparently just doesn t seem to work i can t think of a reason that evolution should provide if none match when deleting an event and i can t think of a reasonable way to work around the issue in cosmo i believe cosmo is doing the right thing i don t have a linux box with a head on it so i can t directly observe the issue the associated cosmo bug is at steps to reproduce access a calendar on a cosmo server or presumably any caldav server attempt to delete an event actual results unknown as i don t have the hardware to test the problem directly the person who reported the cosmo bug simply said can t delete an event with evolution expected results does this happen every time apparently so other information ,1

GOK-116872,right now you can happily start gok if a y support is turned off suggest any at that relies on a y support should check this first and pop up a warning such as assistive technology support not enabled appname requires assistive technology support to be enabled in the assistive technology support preferences window you can do this now but the change will not take effect until you next log in enable and log out enable and close close none of the buttons should start the application or is there any reason to start the application anyway close should just dismiss the alert window enable and close should turn on at support and dismiss the alert window enable and log out should turn on at support and log the user out of their current session none of the three actions should start the application unless there is ever a reason to start the application with at support disabled cc ing docs guys for thoughts on the alert wording ,1
MEDUSA-41895,users home directories are not getting indexed and this is causing some indexing processes to hang additional comments from rebecka eazel com i think this can be solved here by two things use of the seteuid command to set the indexer to be able to read the nfs mount in cases where it does not have access fixing the eventual permissions filtering to not automatically give back root everything and use the search daemons status as root to do a direct access call instead additional comments from rebecka eazel com i added commands to find and skip nfs mount points for now we can do more in this vein if we realize we need to additional comments from darin bentspoon com i changed the title to reflect the remaining problem i consider this a deferrable feature additional comments from bud eazel com this would be required for any enterprise deployments i am marking after additional comments from eli eazel com batch assigning josh as the quality engineering contaact for medusa bugs additional comments from victor eazel com i m not sure if this is serious enough to be considered a must for but it is a very high want it is very common for corporate users to have their home directory in the server and nfs mounted on their system this is what we do here at eazel and i can t search my files does the medusa indexd with the folder option serve as a workaround cheers victor bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1
GTK+-360225,hi i ve been sketching a patch to allow gtknotebook drop tabs anywhere not only in the root window although the patch somewhat works i feel some additions to gtk drag would be welcome issues with the patch all the action happens in drag end and internal flag is used to know whether the drag operation succeeded or not but it s not able to differ between when the drag failed and when the user cancelled the drag to avoid the drag failed animation the code unmaps the drag window but this won t work if the user sets a pixbuf or stock icon as the dnd icon this behavior can be seen in tests testnotebookdnd we still have to wait for the animation timeout to happen before drag end gets called my proposed solution would be to add a drag failed signal emitted as soon as we know the drag failed and reporting the nature of the failure no common target found gui user cancelled timeout exceeded the api user could return true in the handler to tell that the failure has been already handled ie do not show animation or false to let the default implementation handle the failure of course drag end would get called anyways and wouldn t be used for nasty things it wasn t thought for any suggestions ,1

GNOME-CONTROL-CENTER-120842,one of the recent patches to the glade file seems to have changed the way the checkbox headers work before you could click the label e g enable slow keys to set clear the checkbox just like a regular checkbox but now it seems to be two separate controls and you have to actually click the tiny box this is really bad for both accessibility does the unlabelled checkbox have any accessible description even if it does it makes the tab chain much longer and usability works completely differently from any other checkbox ,1

GNOME-BLOG-146106,preferences dialog if an unknown blog type is loaded from gconf or selected from the option menu widget the app will raise an exception because of unset variables or to get right down to it i saw fixme in the code and replaced it the comment said to popup a dialog i also initialized a few variables to avoid exceptions from being raised low priority since the only way a user would see this is if they had a busted gconf entry for the blog type however if that happens they will be unable to correct it via the preferences dialog since it raises an exception before the user has a chance to fix it ,1

GNOME-VFS-46390, find a host that is not reachable that means dns resolution is possible but pinging the hostname never returns a response ipchains magic may make it possible to construct this case type in that host in the nautilus uri bar hit cancel expected navigation stops actual nautilus ui freezes probably for tcp timeout what s going on the gnome vfs http method is blocking indefinitely on a connect it holds a semaphore on the the gnomevfs cancellation context the main thread of nautilus calls gnome vfs async cancel it blocks indefinitely waiting for the semaphore proposed fixes gnomevfs connect and read abstractions could be set to non blocking mode and spin checking for cancellating event this does not handle the case where gethostbyname blocks gnome vfs async cancel could disconnect callback stuff but schedule the job cleanup for later this seems more complicated but more complete additional comments from pavel eazel com use signal to unblock the call as mike points out signal behaves quirky in that it behaves non portably on different implementations if the set of differences was manageable this would be a good solution though because you would end up interrupting a call that othewise locks up resources faster additional comments from mikef praxis etla net very similar to additional comments from mikef praxis etla net pavel oh yeah i don t think a signal will bail out gethostbyname but then i don t know if the job lock is called in the case where gethostbyname is called additional comments from sullivan eazel com seems necessary for additional comments from mikef praxis etla net bug has been marked as a duplicate of this bug additional comments from yakk yakk net bug has been marked as a duplicate of this bug additional comments from don eazel com why isn t this a duplicate of bug additional comments from darin bentspoon com it s reasonable to guess that this might be a duplicate of bug but i don t think there is clear evidence to prove that additional comments from mikef praxis etla net to pavel to add to his doom due to the bad behaviour of gethostbyname see bug it would be best if this were fixed so that gnome vfs async cancel doesn t block even though the thread may hang around for a while removing dependency on additional comments from mikef praxis etla net to respond to darin and don s comments is one of the things that can cause this bug but it is not the only thing and fixing is not the only or best way to fix this bug additional comments from don eazel com making gnome vfs async cancel not block seems like a large task to be tackling now can this really be done in a day bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org bug blocks bug s the original owner pavel eazel com of this bug does not have an account here reassigning to the default owner of the component yakk yakk net ,1

NAUTILUS-SENDTO-334587,if libbtctl can t initialise the bluetooth device then nautilus sendto will crash on startup usually while loading the interface the problem is that if libbtctl fails it will create a new gquark using g quark from static string and the gmodule documentation says if your module introduces static data to common subsystems in the running program e g through calling g quark from static string my module stuff it must ensure that it is never unloaded by calling g module make resident so using g module close on the bluetooth plugin will remove a quark from a static string and crash nautilus sendto whenever another quark is registered the attached patch adds the never unload struct member so that modules that say so can t be unloaded it also fixes don t use home made str has suffix we have g str has suffix use g dir open instead of opendir don t leak the plugins directory on startup mark as static functions that are not used anywhere else namespace the plugins so as to avoid clashes with system libraries confusing the hell out of libtool libbluetooth so is the generated library as well as the system bluetooth library use gerror properly in the bluetooth module fix a couple of warnings in the evo plugin,0

GTK+-85703,gtkwindow c makes the assumption that window screen is always non null because of the window screen gdk get default screen in gtk window init but gdk get default screen should be able to return null currently it can t because there gdk parse args but no equivalent way to initialize gtk without opening a screen but that s a bug to preserve the simple formula that a widget has a screen if its added to a toplevel window i think we should say that its ok to create a window without a screen but you must set it before using it to make this easily debuggable i d like to see gtkwindow c use gtk window screen interally and make gtk window get screen g warning if window screen null ,1

GDM-338606,this bug has been opened on https launchpad net distros ubuntu source gdm bug the failed to start x screen appears on tty which is ok by itself but when the boot process finishes init will launch a getty on top of the failed to start x screen there are interesting side effects for this if the user logs in the session works just fine until the user presses tab at that point the gdm dialog will take precedence and hijacks the tty long story short it might be good to launch the dialog to some other tty the initial idea afaik was to launch the dialog in last tty but since gdm startup was moved up in the boot up tty is not occupied at the time of the error itself this has been checked with dapper upgraded from breezy by default gdm uses tty you are saying that when you do ctrl alt f you get the gdm screen maybe i wasn t too clear about the problem ubuntu boots gdm fails to start and displays the error dialog getty is launched on top of the error dialog now dialog takes some keypresses while others go to getty the problem is that the dialog and getty get started on the same tty should xkeepscrashing dialog be on tty too ,0

GTK+-66987,configure in gtk runs the following config shell bin sh libtool config the intention is to run the local copy of libtool but the following shells check path first ksh on aix irix solaris hp ux and sh on aix this means that if you have libtool installed and in the path it will run that copy instead and config runs sed on which expands to libtool which then turns out to be in the current dir i had a different version of libtool installed than the one in gtk so the sed expression it uses to get config stuff did not match anything if config shell bin sh libtool config is used instead stuff works one could argue whether searching the path first is broken or not but it s more than one having this behavior ,0

GTKSOURCEVIEW-317861,distribution version gentoo this is kind of a forward of a bug from meld in meld i have my tab width set to however when i start a new file comparison the tab width is visually if i open the preferences however the tab width entry is set to if i change the tab width the visual reacts properly stephen kennedy dug into it and responded this is very strange if sourceview is disabled or not available comment out the block at filediff py it works as expected in fact if we add as the last line of init line gtk idle add lambda args self load font the problem goes away it seems like sourceview is ignoring tab settings which are set before it is mapped or realized can you chase this up with the sourceview devs original bug http bugzilla gnome org show bug cgi id ,1
GTK+-150607,create a ui definition and add two action groups containing actions with the same name so that they both back the same the ui proxy remove one of the action groups and then change the state of the action in the removed group observe the proxy to respond to the change expected result is that the proxy does not change because the action s group has been removed this bug is caused because disconnect proxy attempts to disconnect two signals from the proxy when they should be disconnected from the action ,0

PYGTK-119738,some of the scripts in examples of pygtk begin with a line that points to python does that mean that these scripts are not python compatible the more usual is some variant of usr bin env python but this breaks if there are multiple python interpretters installed the one where pygtk is installed may not be the first one in a path search one could later install an additional python higher in the path or as documented one could specify python before running configure probably the solution would involve something like having them all be py in with python and letting configure set it to whatever python interpretter is used or else a makefile target or makefile in the examples directory that did the patching which would also allow future inclusion of a make target to install the examples this wouldn t require renaming all of the examples merely putting them all in examples in and then a makefile rule to recursively process the whole thing into examples in marginally related news some of the py scripts need to be chmod x ,0

NAUTILUS-110492,when i double click on a postscript file nautilus complains that nautilus has no installed viewer capable of displaying home jj interesting article extaffair name of file ps yet nautilus is apparently set to open postscript files with gv according to the dialog box to edit the settings for the postscript file type in the file types and programs dialog to get nautilus to do what i apparently already had told it to do i have to right click on the file choose open with other application choose gv from the list of apps for opening postscript files then click in another dialog box to tell nautilus to use gv as the default to open postscript files so when i tell nautilus what to do using the obvious dialog that i can access from the gnome menu nautilus ignores me to tell nautilus what to do in a way that will actually get nautilus to obey me i have to right click and choose a non intuitive item from a pop up menu the open with menu contains both gv and other application and to open an app with gv i have to act as if i m trying to open the file with an other application this is bad ui and very very wrong ,1

GLIB-54946,it would be very useful to have a g object newv function in libgobject the existing g object new and g object new valist are inapropriate in cases where you can t use a c varargs function eg language bindings or maybe a gui builder the contents of the g object new valist is non trivial and accesses a few structure members that are marked private so it doesn t seem safe for a user of the library to reimplement this function without the use of valists ,1

LIBGLADE-423573,autogen sh immediately dies on mac os x saying you must have libtool installed to compile libglade autogen sh calls libtool version to check the libtool version however on mac os x gnu libtool is named glibtool to avoid conflicting with the apple supplied libtool usr bin libtool v apple computer inc version cctools usr bin glibtool version ltmain sh gnu libtool apple also supplies a gnu libtoolize using the same naming convention usr bin glibtoolize version libtoolize gnu libtool to complicate things a fink package called libtool installs the following libtool commands sw bin glibtool sw bin glibtoolize sw bin libtoolize glibtoolize james henstridge inadvertently solved the problem in gtk in by changing autogen sh revision in svn gtk to call libtoolize version instead of libtool version if libtool version dev null then if libtoolize version dev null then this approach works on the mac as long as the fink libtool package is installed without the fink package there is no libtoolize command only usr bin glibtoolize distributed by apple therefore a more robust approach might be to check for glibtool glibtoolize explicitly in autogen h i m in over my head though i ll attach a patch that mimicks james s fix above in case that helps ,1

GDM-342831,hi a couple of weeks ago gdm lost the nodaemon option when it transitioned over to using goption this ended up causing problems in fedora because our init scripts passed the old option and so gdm daemonized on start up this causes problems because we have code to watch for it to exit and restart it automatically since it daemonizes it exits immediately and we end up restarting it over and over again in a tight loop causing the user s cpu usage to jump to see http bugzilla redhat com bugzilla show bug cgi id for more details one potential solution would have been to change our initscripts to use nodaemon instead of nodaemon this would be a bit awkward because we use the same scripts for kdm and xdm and they only supported the one dash variant of nodaemon another option would be to add support back to gdm for nodaemon arguably the command line interface of gdm is part of it s api so it would be nice if it still supported the nodaemon option for backward compatibility with itself and xdm ,0
RHYTHMBOX-363288,when i try to run rhythmbox it crashes because it says the audiocd plugin can t find the nautilus burn init symbol this is because although the audiocd plugin builds links against nautilus cd burner the plugin isn t linked against the nautilus cd burner library i suspect this doesn t cause problems on linux since the library is linked in by the rhythmbox process itself however on solaris it is more picky and requires that the plugin library also link against the library i m attaching a simple patch that fixes rhythmbox so the symbol is found and works on solaris and other operating systems that are picky like this ,0

GNOME-VFS-313474,i have several problems with volume handling once that i mount a volume using gnome volume manager or by double clicking a drive in the computer window the popup that i get clicking the right button of the mouse still says mount volume instead of umount volume once that a volume is mounted if i double click on the drive in the computer window no window is open for viewing the contents what i get is an error saying that the volume is already mounting when a volume is mounted cdrom or usb memory key it should appear on the desktop but it does not i have the apps nautilus volumes visible set to true all of this worked ok in gnome i m using a hal enabled gnome vfs and hal and gnome vfs from cvs head ,1

NAUTILUS-46859,libnautilus extensions nautilus gtk macros h uses several macros of the form foo signal null foo signal args where foo signal args is sometimes an expression whose value is used and is sometimes void in which case the macro is of course used like a statement depending on which signal is being used needless to say the type of the conditional expression is impossible to define when foo signal args has void type any compiler other than gcc will complain bitterly about this fact and ostracize you at parties even if the value of the conditional expression isn t being used in fact i ve heard rumors that current gcc and thus the next release will also error out on such poorly behaved expressions although i don t have an easy way to check since the macros are sometimes used as statements with void values and sometimes used as expressions with non void values it is very hard to work around this problem with a local patch i ve been having to define expression and statement versions of each macro and make a raft of modifications to the call sites i would appreciate if the nautilus developers could find an alternative practice which isn t so specific to gcc additional comments from darin bentspoon com it s easy to make a variant of the macro for void return type and another variant for of the macro non void return types i can also think and see if i can come up with another solution the problem for me is that i can t test the fix without a non gcc compiler to test with it would be great if i could figure out a way to make this fail on gcc as well perhaps with pedantic it would fail but we can t use that because so many headers are incompatible with it does anyone know why this was not an issue when compiling on solaris does the solaris c compiler also accept this non standard code idiom additional comments from snickell stanford edu its not an issue on solaris because everyone in their right mind uses gcc to compile gnu stuff already most gnu gnome stuff of any size won t compile without gcc and gmake anyway sun is also using gcc i believe additional comments from ghudson mit edu it s true that a lot of gnome packages uses gcc specific features i ve been building gnome on irix with the native cc and it s quite an uphill battle so far i have not seen any statement from any gnome person as to whether this is policy or just the result of carelessness ignorance individual developer preferences there are certainly platforms where the native compiler is pretty decent and where the gcc is relatively weak so it would be a bit of a shame to decide that gcc should be assumed at any rate i think this particular problem should be addressed because a it is much harder to patch around than a few instances of void pointer arithmetic and b as i said earlier i believe the next version of gcc is unlikely to allow condition int expression void expression even if the current gcc does additional comments from darin bentspoon com no need to convince me i have this fixed already and i m just working on the commit additional comments from victor eazel com this is not an easy one for qe to verify here making ghudson mit edu reponsible for the verification of the fix i e qa contact please try and mark the report verified else reopen bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

GSTREAMER-114560,when hooking the rfc enc component from the mpegstream plugin up to an mpeg video source the component sends over buffers with a payload of size zero to reproduce do gst launch v filesrc location myelementarympegstream mpg rfc enc fakesink dump true the problem lies in gst mpegstream gstrfc enc c where the merging of buffers is done incorrectly in all cases probably due to an old api change of gst buffer merge they way it is used it is given arguments being the to be merged buffers the context shows that it expects the result to be in the buffer given as the first argument but the api says that the function creates a new buffer and fills it with the concatenation of the two buffers and returns that i have checked this by creating a new pointer variable and using that to collect the return value and using that in the code that follows it this works as expected ,1

GNOME-VFS-47192, this is a paraphrase of robey s description mouseover on a button on the new softcat in a product detail page while not logged in url looks like eazel install anonymous product name gnucash clicking on the button takes you to eazel install robey thinks this might be a gnome vfs bug additional comments from aelman eazel com note this is definitely a bug as it prevents anonymous use of the new softcat although perhaps that s desirable after all additional comments from mikef praxis etla net actually it might be in nautilus mozilla view i m on it additional comments from mikef praxis etla net the really mystifying thing here is that the install view seems to be getting the right uri even if the right uri isn t on the location bar additional comments from mikef praxis etla net robey i m going to kill you for using the anonymous uri that explicitly breaks shit in the gnome vfs uri canonicalization function oh well i ll make it work additional comments from mikef praxis etla net not only that but the canonicalization function wants to escape the which is actually correct behaviour i think since the isn t part of a query string additional comments from mikef praxis etla net actually to be honest what s wrong here is that gnome vfs is actually trying to parse an authority field for a uri that it should have nothing to do with additional comments from don eazel com approved for mike does this look like it s fixable additional comments from mikef praxis etla net this has been fixed additional comments from brett eazel com could someone give me the eazel trilobite configure pl command that should be used to test against the new softcat additional comments from mikef praxis etla net oh i just stuffed the url in an html file on my local apache additional comments from robey bugs lag net it s okay for vfs to quote the it s done that for a long time so we expect it additional comments from robey bugs lag net also i want to point out that http user pass host port is allowed in urls so p additional comments from brett eazel com as near as i can tell this bug is fixed i can t reproduce a case where eazel install is the resulting url from following a link of another url i created an html files that had the link mentioned in this bug report and nautilus handled it correctly perhaps this should be tested by someone more familiar with the services environment i can t currently access stage services for testing there sherry could you please investigate this thanks bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org the original reporter aelman eazel com of this bug does not have an account here reassigning to the exporter unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

F-SPOT-335935,please describe the problem the export to folder feature uses file names based on the image name if one is to export pictures with same file name but of course different paths the last one to be exported clobbers the others the filename is desirable as it is sometimes based on the topic of the image and is memory friendly for url look this is at http something photos funny face jpg but this prevents having pictures with the same base name to be exported together and all of my panoramic pictures built with hugin use panoramic jpg panoramic jpg beginning at for each photo session steps to reproduce open f spot select pictures that have the same name on disk export them to folder open index html actual results index shows only one picture in multiple copies expected results index shows many pictures in one copy each does this happen every time yes other information patch included rationale for using dbitem id as complement to the image is as follows when using more complex export destinations image name should probably be a constant therefore not something based on the order in which the photos were selected or with which photos they were selected something dependent on the complete path would be too long the id in the db looks fine could be printed in hex form to make it shorter or in base mapped to a z patch applies cleanly after applying patch for will be fuzzy else only line numbers changed ,1

GNOME-PANEL-91378,description of problem it is possible by accident to change the background type in panel properties without the gui updating the activated widgets for example setting it to image without the image selection becoming active this could very well be a gtk bug but i can t confirm that steps to reproduce the problem set background type to default press the optionlist button at a place where your mouse pointer won t be placed on top of the list don t move your mouse move your pointer from the outside to the image without selecting anything but image move your pointer out again without selecting another value and click on some empty space actual results the optionlist will change it s value but nothing will get updated also it won t be saved expected results the real bug is that the selection won t be cleared when moving the pointer out of the selection when doing the above actions i guess this is to enable keyboard navigation it is also reproducable by pressing the button then using the keyboard to change values and clicking with the mouse on empty space it will change the value but do nothing maybe when clicking on an empty area or anything but the optionlist it should revert the value to whatever it was before it was opened i hope this wasn t too confusing ,0

GNOME-TERMINAL-92215,package gnome terminal severity normal version gnome synopsis ui bad wording in right click menu bugzilla product gnome terminal bugzilla component general description description of problem i found this usability problem when right clicking in the gnome terminal window or choosing file it gives you the possibility to chose a new window but i get a new terminal right clicking a nautilus drawn desktop it rightfully offers you a menu choice of new terminal but also new window solution my suggestion to a solution would be to change the wording in the terminal right click menu to new terminal since that is what the user wants expects and since it would make sense with respect to nautilus one might ask if the nautilus right click menu should not also have another wording than new window for a new nautilus window maybe but i can not find anything better what is gained as i see it two things consistency across applications since the new terminal menu entry always gives you the same removes the problem that the new window menu entry at present is at the top of both the terminal and nautilus menus making it harder for a user to distinguish the two menus without becoming aware of other menu entries that seperate the two menus bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org reassigning to the default owner of the component hp redhat com ,1

NAUTILUS-46495,to reproduce boink on the location bar key in something now hit control a the keybinding for beginning of line notice how it doesnt and instead the icon container selects all this is tragic additional comments from tim eazel com emacs style locationbar editing conflicts with nautilus keybindings such as cltr a cltr f cltr b see bug personaly i think temperary disable nautilus keybinds for cltr a b f when locationbar is in editing might be a good solution i like emacs style editing too additional comments from sullivan eazel com we deliberately disabled the emacs style keybindings in nautilusentry to allow the menu shortcuts which are visibly displayed in the user interface to work it s a choice of supporting the visibly displayed keyboard equivalents or the hidden ones i don t know how to make a sensible compromise here having a preference for this seems bad but is a way out i suppose i m going to torture arlo with thinking about this further by assigning it to him made it just to make sure it gets looked at we don t necessarily need to change anything in my opinion additional comments from ramiro fateware com so i can see the rationale for this the only reason why i noticed the bug is because that is the behavior ive come to expect with gtkentry widgets so nautilus violating the sanctity of gtkentry emacs key bindings might make sense in the grand scheme of things however its something that will be noticed as annoying by current gtk users oh yeah it is also the way netscape works on linux additional comments from don eazel com not a blocker sorry additional comments from sullivan eazel com i changed the title to reflect the fact that this emacs keybinding ignoring code is not in the location bar code itself but in the nautilusentry class that the location bar is an instance of many of our other text fields in nautilus are also of this type so the same behavior occurs in them people used to the emacs bindings will be very annoyed at this behavior we ve seen enough evidence of this to know it s true i think the issue might become moot in gtk because owen said that they will probably change the behavior to give the global ui pieces like the menu first crack at the keyboard shortcut and only use it in the focused widget if the menu bar doesn t take it this seems to me like the best possible solution if we get a ton of flack about this before that solution is implemented we should probably consider the preference approach additional comments from darin bentspoon com one problem related to john s comments above is that some of our gtkentry esque objects are actual gtkentry objects and others are nautilusentry subclass objects so this is not consistent throughout nautlius i don t know if it s practical to make every single gtkentry in nautilus be a nautilusentr since presumably some are created by library functions additional comments from jacob ximian com this bug is extremely annoying every single other text entry i deal with on a day to day basis has c a c e and c k working the same except for nautilus especially when in some views the select all menu item is desensitized mozilla let s me hit c a in the location bar and have it work how i d expect when the focus is not there c a selects all the text in the page please fix this before additional comments from sullivan eazel com i reset the milestone on this just so the triagers could see the impassioned plea for fixing this for additional comments from don eazel com how hard and or how risky is the fix do we know how to fix it yet and why is this assigned to arlo additional comments from gzr eazel com we need an official decision from our usability experts additional comments from don eazel com just talked to arlo and what we really need to do here until we have globally configurable key bindings in nautilus alone or all of gnome is make use emacs style key bindings in text fields and advanced user option and we can do that in so i m marking this p for that milestone but we don t have time for this in additional comments from sullivan eazel com see also bug which is about this same issue with the sense currently reversed in the notes sidebar panel additional comments from don eazel com maciej is working on a possible key bindings change for additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org i suggest just taking out the hack to avoid processing ctrl a specially in the location bar for it pisses lots of people off and has not made anyone happy from what i can tell we can figure out a better solution later additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org created an attachment id patch additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org the patch above just removes the attempt to override local keybindings a preference seemed like overkill additional comments from sullivan eazel com i think there may be confusion as to what we re trying to accomplish here one comment here says that control a is a problem in particular if we apply maciej s patch control a will mean go to the beginning of the text i e the same thing you would expect home to do i would be much happier with a universe where control a meant select all text i hope somebody doesn t think we re going to get select all text behavior with this patch this patch will mean the rebirth of bug so be sure to re open that bug if we take this patch i think bug is a serious usability problem for non experts whereas this bug is a usability problem for emacs using experts which audience to we want to please right now maybe emacs using experts is the right answer i just want people to realize that this isn t a win win fix i think it s ok to apply this patch but i want to make it clear that we are trading off one problem for another if we do so additional comments from mjs noisehavoc org created an attachment id a patch that does it as an expert only preference additional comments from sullivan eazel com a few comments on the preferences version of the patch the on screen text is unwieldy and contains a misspelling it s currently let emacs style keybindings in location bar take precendece n over global keyboard shortcuts i d suggest use emacs style keyboard shortcuts in all text fields the main thing i don t like about this new wording is that it doesn t tell you the trade off maybe use emacs style keyboard shortcuts in all text fields overriding menu shortcuts that probably won t fit on one line anymore vera any better suggestions is emacs style the right capitalization e g emacs emacs or emacs the preference affects all nautilusentry fields not just the location bar text field we could make it only affect the location bar but i think that would be wrong note that i took out the location bar reference in my proposed text but the name of the preference still has location bar in it which is wrong additional comments from vera eazel com would this fit use emacs style keyboard shortcuts not menu shortcuts in text fields it does appear that emacs is correct capital e the rest lowercase additional comments from sullivan eazel com we d have to try and see if that fits but it s definitely an improvement over any of the earlier proposals additional comments from darin bentspoon com we use hour to mean got the patch just need to commit not hours additional comments from sullivan eazel com vera s text would still be the longest item anywhere in preferences and thus increase the window width that s not the case if we leave off the not menu shortcuts part i think if we decide to take this at the last minute for then we should just use the shorter form use emacs style keyboard shortcuts in text fields note lack of period after we d like to redesign the layout of the preferences window somehow so that we can use a little more explanatory text per item when necessary additional comments from josh eazel com ok from a normal person s point of view i just learned that most entry fields use emacs keybindings this is shocking in itself but that s beside the point i think that no matter what widget has focus the program assigned keybindings should take precedent either that or the text in the edit menu should change when you click on an editable text box stupid josh additional comments from vera eazel com the shortened version is fine as another normal person this took me by surprise too additional comments from don eazel com hmmmm i would still like this to be some advanced user preference or something marking this p because i wan t us to decide soon additional comments from sullivan eazel com i think we should check this in as is with the short form of vera s text and maybe tweaking the preference name right away maybe we will be able to eliminate it some day maybe we will improve the text in the future as is it s definitely something that will make some users very happy additional comments from niles scyld com bug has been marked as a duplicate of this bug additional comments from niles scyld com let me just add my vote that nautilus is great but this one issue makes it totally unusable for me i thought eazel focus was on usability additional comments from jacob ximian com the attached patch has some bugs a f does word forward instead of bringing up the file menu there are two problems here i have a m eta key i would think m f should go forward not a f for people without a m key things suck again we can look at what mozilla does partly m f types f and a f brings up the menu if we can m f should probably jump forward additional comments from sullivan eazel com niles usability means different things to different people jacob the patch just reverts the behavior to match all other gtkentry text fields are you suggesting that we change the behavior to be different from other gtkentry fields additional comments from darin bentspoon com the problems jacob mentions are present in all gtk programs that don t go out of their way to work around them while we might want to do the same kind of hack that mozilla has done to make the alt keys work i think it s more appropriate to fix gtk itself jacob i suggest you write a gtk bug report about those problems i ll be applying this patch soon additional comments from darin bentspoon com oops i need to reopen this for consideration for additional comments from sullivan eazel com note that darin started with the patch here but improved it quite a bit also bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

GLIB-120299,sorry if the terminology below is a bit incorrect i easily get lost in the twisty maze of io channels gsources poll fds main loops etc the win implementaion of giochannels g poll etc needs a rewrite it has worked well for gimp and other similar applications but doesn t work for the way the linc library used by orbit uses main loops and gsources for instance there are fundamental problems in how the win implementation of gichannels gsources watching them and gsources with gpollfds that should poll sockets or fds interact it s hard to describe the problem consicely but i ll try the win giochannel code creates a thread for each channel when a watch for the channel is created using g io add watch and friends for file descriptors the thread blocks trying to read from the fd while for sockets it blocks in select this is because there is no api in win that would correspond to select ing on a disk or pipe file descriptor in unix or at least not if the file descriptor is created in a program out of your control if you would write an app from scratch for win you could of course handle files in special ways to enable select like functionality and much more but as glib is to be used from apps using more or less normal ansi c and unixish functionality that doesn t help the win g poll implementation waits for events signalled from those per channel threads until now this has worked quite well in gimp and other apps but linc reveals several problems with this approach for instance there is undesirable dependency between win giochannels and the gsources watches created and added to them with g io add watch the thread for a socket selects for in out exception only for those watches added to it with g io add watch and even worse only the channel s own read method for fds or the channel s own check method ever resets the event that woke up g poll it isn t possible to create a watch for the socket using your own kind of gsource add gpollfds to it even if the gpollfd has been created with g io channel win make pollfd and attach that gsource to a main loop context and run that loop and expect things to work another problem is that the current code doesn t scale well the waitformultipleobjects used in g poll has a relatively low limit of handles that it can waited on simultaneously which is much too low for many types of applications the rewritten code should presumably work somehow like this it probably is a good idea to drop the concept that gpollfd fd on win must be a handle let it be a file descriptor or socket similarily as on unix and handle it transparently there hopefully shouldn t be many applications or libraries out there that know that know to put handles in gpollfd fd it s more important to make porting software that puts file descriptors or sockets in them easy for giochannels to files pipes or gpollfds there still needs to be one thread per file that is being polled however the creation of the thread should probably be postponed until g poll actually is called but the thread probably still once created has to be blocking trying to read from the fd all the time when polling several fds there is no way to unblock the other threads when one of the fds has fired for sockets one should save on the number of threads used and use just one thread for each set of up to fd setsize sockets the thread for sockets shouldn t be blocking in select all the time only when in g poll it should be possible to have several gsources with gpollfds for the same socket linc does this but attached to different main loop contexts as long as they aren t running at the same time or something like that the g poll implementation shouldn t use one event for each fd or sockets thread as the limit of handles in a waitformultipleobject call is limited to use just on event and then additional logic to find out which gpollfd it actually was ,1

GEDIT-PLUGINS-382937,please describe the problem i noticed that the time to startup gedit was very long i timed it to around seconds i tried disabling all plugins after that gedit starts almost instantly i found that the offending plugin is the filesystem browser pane when i enable it in the preference dialogue it freezes gedit and after about seconds it starts responding again i then found that i have a nautilus bookmark where the target is an sftp url where the server is currently unavailable when clicking this bookmark in nautilus it incidentally takes around seconds for nautilus to come to the conclusion that the target is unreachable displaying the dialog box stating that the resource is not available i then removed this bookmark and the filesystem browser pane plugin loads instantly so it would seem that the plugin tries to access the bookmarks when loading which would explain this behavior also gedit stopped responding to user input when i added such a bookmark when gedit was running with the plugin loaded it repainted all widgets but did not respond to any input steps to reproduce add an sftp bookmark in nautilus pointing to a server that is unreachable start gedit and enable the filesystem browser pane plugin actual results expected results does this happen every time yes other information i m using ubuntu edgy i can try to provide more information on request ,0

GTK+-154350,whenever we set a new model to the icon view we need to invalidate the icon view priv cursor item and icon view priv anchor item by assigning null to them the present codebase doesn t invalidate these pointers and this leads to chaotic condition when we operate using navigation keys this bug can not be reproduced with the icon view demo program because it does t unset and set the model whenever we choose a directory to list its contents possible solution in fn gtk icon view set model we need to insert the following code in an appropriate position icon view priv cursor item null new code icon view priv anchor item null i inserted this piece of code in the follg location and it worked fine for me if model gtype pixbuf column type text column type if icon view priv model g signal handlers disconnect by func icon view priv model gtk icon view row changed icon view icon view priv model model add new code here icon view priv cursor item null icon view priv anchor item null if icon view priv model g object ref icon view priv model how to reproduce if anyone wants to reproduce this problem you can download eccvs from http eccvs sourceforge net down html and follw the procedure given below execute eccvs now you can be able to see a brower like interface use down arrow and you can see that first item is selected press return enter key now browse through inner directories by only using navigation keys and return key press backspace key to go to the parent directory now press down arrow and you can be able to see that no item is selected this is because the cursor item is pointing to a different item that is not at all present in the current model items you may have to browse through many directories to actually get this problem ,0

GNOME-MENUS-312274,if gnome menus is installed in a non standard prefix and python s path settings do not include this prefix gmenu simple editor does not run because the python module could not be loaded a simple fix is to include the following snippet into the gmenu simple editor executable this is a python script containing the following lines import sys sys path path to dir sys path this ensures that the program will run with the correct python package the path should be generated by some autoconf voodoo magic ,0

EVOLUTION-218853,evolution manual page starts from the following evolution run ximian evolution the gnome groupware suite synopsis evolution option uri description this program is a graphical groupware suite documentation for evolution is available in my opinion the term graphical groupware suite is rather unfortunate technical and unclear for the typical user i would rather write something like that as i am not native english speaker i could make some mistakes evolution sophisticated mailer calendar and task editor working in gnome environment description ximian evolution is a mailing calendaring software working in gnome environment functionally similar to microsoft outlook tm evolution can be used to send and read mail edit todo lists handle calendar and edit contact lists complete documentation is available this way the user who accidentally reads the manpage gets basic understanding of the application purpose the term graphical groupware can only confuse the reader it would be also probably a good idea to extend the manpage with some crucial information like pointing that evolution can handle multiple mail accounts using local folders pop and imap with ssl that it can use ldap etc but this is less important ,1

GTK+-357078,distribution my linux release rainbow package evolution severity normal version gnome x gnome distributor red hat inc synopsis crash while dragging a mail message to another folder bugzilla product evolution bugzilla component calendar bugzilla version x bugbuddy gnomeversion description description of the crash i was in the process of dragging a message from my sent items folder to one of its subfolders when the crash occurred this was a fluke occurrence because i had just seconds before moved another message from the sent items folder to another subfolder if it makes any difference the message that i had completed moving was the last message in the sent items folder and the one i had started to drag was the second to last the status bar at the bottom reads fetching summary information for new messages in csaenz complete that s the folder i had dropped the previous message into also evolution has been spending a lot of time re fetching summary information for each new folder i use because our office has just replaced the mail server and the new server has a different host name i m using imap and apparently it isn t smart enough to reuse the evolution mail imap cache from the previous account settings when i change the login name host name or even port number even though the remote mail store is always the same steps to reproduce the crash i don t know if this can be easily reproduced but i m guessing set up some large folders on an imap server change the host name or port used to access the same imap server e g by using a proxy open up one of the folders drag a message to one of the other folders drag another message to a different folder how often does this happen first time as i said i had dragged other messages to different folders before without crashing additional information i had recently months ago upgraded to gnome just earlier this week at the same time the office was upgrading the mail server from ms exchange to ms exchange i upgraded evolution from to i was completely inable to get evolution to connect to the imaps server it kept saying ssl unavailable i was able to connect by setting up an ssl proxy using stunnel on my local machine debugging information backtrace was generated from usr bin evolution no debugging symbols found using host libthread db library lib tls libthread db so thread

GNOME-APPLETS-159903,i file this seperate from the other locations love bug because i am not sure if this is a bug or a feature up to now i only saw cities or other defined places like airports in gwether now there are some provinces strangely enough not all of them just two this concerns the locations ober sterreich and nieder sterreich both of them are larger areas bundesl nder and have a widely varying weather on their different parts see eg for weather in ober sterreich upper austria http wetter orf at ooe i ll attach a patch against my other patch though likely it s easier to simply nuke these locations by hand don t hesitate to contact me if you ve got further questions ralph aichinger ,0

ATK-363128,gail currently only exports a very small number of interfaces in libgail util these interfaces are provided specifically so that custom widgets can more easily and consistently implement the atk interfaces in general we don t want to export the other gail headers since the implementation details of how atk is provided for specific widgets is not something we want to require bincompat for nor do we want these interfaces in general to be used externally other than the ones in libgail gnome however virtually every custom widget atk implementation in every app or toolkit that implements custom widgets would like to inherit from gailwidget gailwidget s type and class structs are actually very simple so it would not be harmful to expose them this would simplify the task of writing custom widgets somewhat and eliminate the need to do hackish anonymous inheritance tricks as suggested in this paper http developer gnome org projects gap presentations guad c making apps accessible anonymous inheritance html i attach a patch which exports gailwidget h ,1

GALEON-75693,older versions of galeon like most other browsers seem to default the size of new browser windows to the size of the last one closed this is a bit weird but one can get used to it and work with it especially since so many browsers do it the current version of galeon seems to set the size to the size of the window you are opening the new one from this superficially seems like a good idea but it s a big pain if you re opening a new window from an odd sized window in particular i use an application called bookmarker that displays a tree view of my net resident bookmarks in a tall skinny window with the current version of galeon any time i click on a link in the bookmark window it opens up in a tall skinny window instead of a normal sized one arrgh is there some way around this many things would be better than what happens now such as going back to the old behavior or having a way to set a fixed size for new windows in the preferences in desperation i may have to hack bookmarker to use some javascript to create windows of a specific size when i click on the bookmarks instead of just letting them be normal links i think that will be a lot of work ,1

GOSSIP-309912,currently if the client receives e g a publish subscribe notification in the form of a with a properly namespaced child and typically without a element the message is put in the message queue a sound is played and the appropriate icons start blinking as if a normal chat message was received when clicking one of the blinking icons an empty message window appears which is not very intuitive this is how it should be dealt with when the client receives a without a element and only childs with unknown namespaces the message should be silently dropped if there is a element and there are no extension elements recognised that would override that body the body should be shown for example a xhtml im message would have both a and a xhtml im namespaced element if the client recognises the latter the body element can be ignored as it is meant as a fallback ,1

GIMP-730071,if you create a square fill it with a color and then double the size of the background image borders the selection has pixel more in width and height when using selection from alpha start gimp and create a new image with the size x remove the default white layer and create a new layer with transparent background fill the layer with this color ad ff so you got a clean blue square deselect everything now go to image image size not the scaling but the one which enlargens the background frame and enlargen it to x now rightclick on your blue square in the middle again and do selection from alpha now when you check with the selection tool you can see that the selected area is x instead of x x i can reproduce this any time and it has become a real annoyance since i often use specific selections and dimensions to copy and paste data ,0

GPDF-112140,if i open up a pdf document in gpdf the pageup and pagedown keys do not initially work however i can hit the up arrow or down arrow key twice and then the arrow keys work at this point pageup also starts to work moving up one screenful at a time which is good see below however pagedown does not work unless i use the arrows to move to the bottom of the page at that point pagedown will move by one physical page at a time in the document so if an entire page does not fit on the screen i cannot read the top portions of the page there really needs to be a pair of keys that allow one to move forwards and backwards through the document with a single keypress moving one key at a time in xpdf this is done by pageup and pagedown and by space and backspace so if you are motivated by this report to make pageup and pagedown work on physical document pages please include another keybinding to move a screenful at a time ,0
GDM-334186,i am creating this bug to be a single place to mention all config features that should be available in gdmsetup that are not this way i can close a number of bugs it is better to fix these all at once if possible i think we need to add back a general tab since many of these features don t fit into local remote a y security users to fit the hig we can only add one more tab should be able to disable multiple logins from a single user alwayslogincurrentsession key probably general tab this is just a checkbox to add should be able to specify default session defaultsession key probably general tab this should be a dropdown selection with the available sessions require a bit of work to add logic to gdmsetup to lookup existing sessions should be able to specify priority in the server foo section probably should be a spinbutton see configure x server button on security tab should be able to specify alwaysrestartserver value since many users like to set this probably general tab this is just a checkbox to add might want to include some text explaining that this is useful to turn on if users find the xserver crashes or hogs resources if left running for a long time should be able to specify halt shutdown reboot command probably general tab or maybe security tab since that s where you specify whether the systemmenu is visible or not this would just be string entries should be able to specify relaxpermissions and checkdirowner value since many users have facedirs etc mounted over nfs and want the face browser to work should be on security tab same goes for neverplacecookiesonnfs security tab relax permissions is a drop down with selections that correspond to in the config file see comments for descriptions checkdirowner is a checkbox as is neverplacecookiesonnfs should be able to specify gtkrc file since it would be nice if users could specify the gtk theme to use for gdmlogin this also affects the gtk elements in gdmgreeter entry f options menu etc so should go in general tab probably should be a file selection dialog should be able to specify minimaluid defaultface and globalfacedir for better facebrowser management should go in users tab minimaluid coudl be a spinbutton defaultface and globalfacedir are file selection dialogs should be able to set usecirclesinentry useinvisibleentry to configure how password should look as entered probably general tab both are checkboxes should be able to specify use hourclock since users like to change this general tab this is a checkbox not so easy should be able to specify quiver value since lots of users don t like this should go in local remote tab when gdmlogin is picked since this only affects gdmlogin this is a checkbox this isn t so easy since the local remote tab is a bit dynamic should be able to specify lockposition setposition positionx positiony for gdmlogin should go in local remote tab when gdmlogin is picked these are checkboxes or int entry values that could be spinbuttons should be able to set chooserbutton to turn off the ability to launch gdmchooser from login screen also would be nice to be able to set the various chooser config options though not sure what tab this belongs in hard should be able to create new users in gdmsetup probably users tab note that the about me applet has logic to do this perhaps it could be ported into gdm there s probably more that could be added but that s a pretty good list to start with and captures a lot of the issues that i think are important ,1
SCAFFOLD-81066, open anjuta switch to a different tab in the dock close anjuta open anjuta again note that the tab switch doesn t save however the tab switch is saved when the dock s layout is changed to fix this the layout xml should be saved either on each tab switch or on exit on exit is probably good enough for now ,0
EVOLUTION-211667,as i use imap mail the mail summary is useless to me i removed the folders from the summary preferences but there is still a mail summary heading with no content surely this heading should disappear ,1

NAUTILUS-CD-BURNER-119991,there are usability problems with writing cds in gnome even n c b is installed because going to burn or choosing go cd creator from menu are not easy to found for most users i think menu entry desktop file cd burner should be added in accessories or system tools menu categories when user press on cd burner nautilus cd burner should be lauched then if there are no files in burn user will see dialog you need to copy the files you want to write to cd to the cd creator window would you like to open it now and buttons close and open cd creator i think this is user friendly because from this dialog simple user got all information how to write cd and then he can simply press open cd creator button copies the files into the cd creator window and press write to cd button if there already are files in burn location then nautilus cd burner command displays write files to a cd recorder dialog i think this is ok but one more button open cd creator or maybe it s can be named show files to be written should be added to this dialog if user press this button then cd creator window nautilus with burn locaton is displayed i m attaching screenshot of improved write files to a cd recorder dialog to this bug btw when nautilus displays burn location tittle of nautilus window should be not burn but cd creator because simple users don t know any burn ,1

LSR-414994,firefoxperk requires foresight into where the pointer will wind up after a review command is processed so it can give focus automatically check for document bounds register and unregister review keys etc this foresight is currently gained by invoking the review perk tasks without chaining checking the pointer por then setting the pointer back to its original location and finally allowing the review perk to handle its command as it would have without the chained firefox task interfering this causes unwanted announcements as dotasks and their chains are not blocked during task execution peek tasks in review perk will make dealing with this problem extremely easy ,0

MEDUSA-41338,there needs to be some sort of async system to interrupt searches that are no longer needed additional comments from rebecka eazel com i don t know how many architecture switches this will require some sort of signalling system is needed to allow the search loop to run asynchronously additional comments from bud eazel com if queries complete quickly this could be moved to after moving to usable for now additional comments from sullivan eazel com doesn t pressing stop or navigating elsewhere work if so please reset the priority of this bug to p additional comments from rebecka eazel com this bug concerns the fact that after the search daemon receives a query there is no way to prevent it from running the entire query if a lot of queries get backed up the search daemon will stop responding however as bud said queries complete quickly under a few seconds so perhaps we should move this bug to after additional comments from rebecka eazel com i think we can avoid this now that the server deals with cancelled queries by ignoring them as bud mentioned queries are pretty fast so the value of this feature to the end user seems dubious it s not clear what will be faster or better if queries can be interrupted additional comments from eli eazel com batch assigning josh as the quality engineering contaact for medusa bugs bug moved to this database by unknown bugzilla gnome org ,1

EVOLUTION-249844,english is one of few languages that doesn t differ between genders for nouns in many other languages it s absolutely essential to use the correct gender and correct gender adjectives for the noun thus the new menu and new button in evolution are very problematic for translation as the adjective new can and in the case of evolution very much does refer to many different types of objects and words words that are nouns and that have different genders and that thus needs different variants of the adjective new to be anything remotely similar to correct language because of this the entire concept of having a single new menu and a single new button for creating many different types of objects is fundamentally flawed from a linguistic point of view still the current situation in evolution could be improved would the new menu entries be altered so that their meaning could be self contained so instead of the current menu layout new mail message new all day appointment new contact new contact list new appointment new meeting new post message new task new folder new shortcut new evolution window one would also add new to the submenu entry names to make them fully qualifed and make it possible to at least translate the messages in the submenus correctly new new mail message new new all day appointment new new contact new new contact list new new appointment new new meeting new new post message new new task new new folder new new shortcut new new evolution window,1

GLIBMM-306310,distribution version se glib get home dir throws an exception on a windows system i suppose the glib function returns null because this is a single user system without user profiles starting it in a mingw console makes it work maybe because of a then set home environment variable a fix would be to return an empty string or to document the exception gtkmm compiled under mingw msys with gcc win se,0

GNOME-VFS-81076,gnome vfs doesn t seem to handle fork it needs to use pthread atfork so that the mutexes are ok in the child process i e not locked forever the glibc info docs contain a section about this it also probably needs to do something about the job table and the state of any operations underway maybe just clear them in the child process the other alternative is to say gnome vfs will not work across a fork which is ok as long as it is documented somewhere nautilus thumbnailing code seems to assume it does work across fork at present bug may be related to this ,1

EOG-356947,i have cooked a small patch to remove from the eog ng branch the unused dependence on libgnomeprint ui and use instead of it the high level gtk printing api it still needs some work but i would like it to be reviewed so i can continue work on the eog ng branch some issues there is no way for the user to resize the image nor move it in the page resizing the printing job is not going to work properly for the former i guess i would need to add a dialog to be shown before the actual gtkprintunixdialog is shown so the user can set there his preferences current implementation in head and previous eog versions sucks regarding this as there is no way to adjust these settings i made the dependence on gtk unix print hard as this is included in gtk and eog already depends on this version of the toolkit i saw no reason for making printing support optional please comment on the code so we can improve it and have printing support soon in this branch ,1
VTE-499944,in the fix for bug that i m going to commit shortly one way to fix it would be to check for printable chars before rendering that may impose unwanted overhead and also be regarded as regression another way to fix is to add a second invisible attribute for internal hiding only i didn t like that enough to do it right now that invisible attr is private anyway should fix this before making invisible attr public ,1

GTK-DOC-395005,gtkdoc scan rev skips declarations of private headers marked but it still outputs myprivateheader to decl list txt this causes bogus undocumented symbols short and long description of myprivateheader when section file it built fully automatically and requires unnecessary edits when it s edited manually the most thorough skip would be simply index gtkdoc scan in gtkdoc scan in revision gtkdoc scan in working copy while if this is a private header skip it if m s s s last close input return skip to the end of the current comment or maybe even w o the close i m not sure about the scope and finalization of filehandles in perl this also stops the emission of get my private type to types file which is imo correct in other words the above change would make private headers identical to ignored headers i suppose that was the original intention i cannot imagine how the inspection of private classes could reveal anything that should appear in the public documentation ,0

crash bugzilla product nautilus bugzilla component general bugzilla version bugbuddy gnomeversion description description of the crash dragging an item into the trash will usually cause nautilus to freeze or crash which one it does seems to be random the freeze or crash occurs at the point that the object being dragged to the trashcan passes over the trashcan this never happens when one selects the move to trash context menu option on the object being trashed steps to reproduce the crash drag item to trash empty trash drag another item to the trash expected results item should be placed into trashcan how often does this happen every time after the trash has been emptied except for the first time an item is dragged to the trashcan after nautilus has started up if the trash is empty and nautilus has just been started the operation will work fine as will all subsequent attempts to drag an item i ve been testing with folders to the trashcan but once the trash is emptied the next

crashed after i closed a tab scenario i had two tabs open in my history so at startup it tried to load them both i then closed the second tab before viewing it at that point a crash occurred i ve closed tabs before just fine so i m guessing that it is because the second tab was being brought up at startup and closed before it was ever viewed and possibly before it had finished loading note that it was a simple basically all text page so even though the trace is in the mozilla wrapper somewhere i m really doubting it was a mozilla crash debugging information backtrace was generated from

ORCA-468098,i looked at the spec for whereami and compared it to what we are doing here is the situation radio button groups were not always being announced in whereami yet were when focus initially moved there e g via tab for an example look at the printing example in gtk demo issue whereami s getgrouplabel is only looking at panels labels for panels can also be found in fillers mnemonics for combo boxes and sliders are not being announced the issue seems to be that you can t associate a mnemonic directly with these objects so instead you set a couple of properties on the label use underline and mnemonic widget this causes pressing alt the underlined letter to give focus to the object identified in mnemonic widget it also means that we can t use action getkeybinding to obtain accelerators for combo boxes sliders don t even seem to have actions spin button values are being announced twice e g copies spin button alt s we should only announce it once i checked with mike and he indicated that we should speak the displayed value the spec should be updated to reflect this we re not quite following the spec for menu items especially not when looking at the example utterances example of what we should be saying file menu open control o item of o what we are saying file open control o menu item item of alt fo tabs in a tab list the example in the spec is tab list braille page item of we re saying page item of braille page i also discovered through the printing example in gtk demo that we might have hidden page tabs e g showing but in existence we aren t handling the case of hidden page tabs tree tables we aren t speaking expanded for expanded items in addition it is not clear from the spec if relative position means relative to the entire tree or with respect to just the parent node mike indicated via email it means relative to the parent node the spec should be updated to reflect this our current implementation is relative to the entire tree i left icon panel alone because i know that rich and mike worked on that as part of the nautilus script the spec might need updating however to reflect the decisions made for nautilus in addition it seems like label and role are repeated in the spec currently it says this icon panels present the following information an example is icon panel mike pedersen item of label if any role label if any role all selected icons followed by selected i m confused about the spec for detailed information double press of kp enter here is the current spec with my comments interspersed when kp enter is pressed twice quickly orca will speak and display the information it currently does when performing the where am i command with the following changes jd i asked mike if speak and display the information it currently does referred to the original implementation of whereami which was extremely detailed and included all objects in the hierarchy from the top down to the current object as i recall or if it instead referred to the current single press mike said the latter orca should pause briefly between items in the hierarchy jd if it s not the original detailed view what items in the hierarchy if this refers to say the menu that contains a menu item does this mean that the single press should not be pausing briefly but instead sticking everything together as a single string without pauses if so then i believe single press needs to be reworked to not pause information regarding relative position should come after the item it pertains to rather than before e g say display euro converter item of jd if you look at the detailed spec for the single press the relative position comes after the item it pertains to therefore there is no difference that i can see between single press and double press w r t position ,1

GNOME-PRINT-52627, this has been reported by stephen p wall to balsa team the file macros gnome print check m contains some code used in building the configure script that contains some lines with the following syntax variable shell command this syntax is appropriate for ksh and bash but not sh on many linux systems bin sh is a link to bash this is not true on solaris and as a result the configure script dies with a syntax error the attached patch changes this to the more compatible variable shell commnand notation ,1

GTK+-172633,problem some stock icons are really dated probably they are the last survivors from x releases they don t fit the look of the other elegant stock icons made for the x series icons that needs update stock apply png stock cancel png stock no png stock ok png those can be found in last gtk version gtk stock icons proposed solution use the stock icons that jakub steiner did for the industrial gtk theme since mr steiner did most of the current default stock icons and his work with the industrial icon theme fits really well inside the default artwork this would be the most obvious solution the list of icons extracted directly from the gtk theme stock apply png can be used for stock yes png stock down png stock left png stock top png stock bottom png stock first png stock refresh png stock up png stock cancel png can be used for stock no png stock last png stock right png stock right png stock apply png can be used for stock yes png stock down png stock left png stock ok png stock top png stock bottom png stock first png stock refresh png stock up png stock cancel png can be used for stock no png stock last png rename them as appropriate and replace the old icons known problems it seems that the most problematic icons stock apply png stock cancel png stock no png stock ok png are x px i m not sure why they are there with such an unusual size usually they are x px or x px since the stock icons that mr steiner did for industrial are x px they cannot be used directly instead of those ones resizing them would be a poor solution so i m wondering if we can use x px images instead of x i ve baked my own solution renamed all the stuff and added the icons but i m not sure if this would be appropriate so i m not sending it attached if you need further explanation help i ll be glad in doing so gtk apply gtk cancel gtk yes and gtk no are the most notable examples since they re used in many dialogs other information important note i ve filed a bug against gnome icon theme to add this stock icons however fixing the stock icons on gnome icon theme would just work for gnome while fixing this on gtk upstream can benefit all apps build with gtk in linux windows and other platforms those little details can improve the experience of the users ,1

GLADE-LEGACY-88020,right now when you fire up glade at least using metacity you get three windows opening right on top of each other properties on top palette second and project window at the bottom since you have to do something in the initially buried project window to make anything in the properties or palette window active suggest it would be better not to open those two windows until you d created or opened a project in fact it would be nice if all the windows positions were saved as part of the project but that s another matter ,1

EVOLUTION-741059,if a module sets ckf protected authentication path in the flags returned from c gettokeninfo you re not supposed to prompt the user for a pin for it you re supposed to let it handle its own login perhaps it ll have a built in keypad or something the gnome keyring module does this because it s automatically unlocked at login time but evolution prompts for a pin for it anyway on a modern fedora system symlink usr lib libnssckbi so to p kit proxy so instead of p kit trust so this will make p kit actually work properly and link in all the configured modules and then you ll see that evolution prompts for a pin while firefox correctly doesn t ,0

EVOLUTION-523327,please describe the problem task and memo preview does not word wrap the text in the body this is very annoying because the editor details dialog for tasks memo does word wrap so users get one very long line with a vertical scrollbar in the preview it is of course possible to get around this by remembering to always insert linebreaks manually whenever you create a task but this feels very clumsy and as if you have to fight the system you also have to consider other resolutions steps to reproduce create a new task or memo and open the editor for it notice how the window is rather small by default write a description letting the input field wrap your text write enough to fill the width of the preview save the task memo and view its preview you ll notice the annoying vertical scrollbar actual results the preview gets a vertical scrollbar instead of word wrapping the text expected results for the preview to word wrap the text does this happen every time yes other information this might not seem like a very big deal but in fact several of my users have been confused by this behaviour a user enters alot of text and separates paragraphs by using two linebreaks and then look at it in the preview the user doesn t notice the vertical scrollbar and it looks like the first line of the first paragraph is followed by the first line of the second paragraph and everything in between is missing ,1
