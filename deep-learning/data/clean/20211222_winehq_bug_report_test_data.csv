WINE-30798,recently i had been investigating wine testcase failures on my linux box and one of them being gdiplus testcase failing two tests at lines font c and font c wine tests results database have results from other linux boxes where this test does succeed so i was wondering what s wrong with it on my system after digging into the code for about an hour it turned out that gdiplus implementation is flawed in a way that it doesn t expect font type to be anything other than raster fonttype or truetype fonttype it is not the case with current wine s freetype based font engine driver for opentype fonts otf they are treated to be device fonttype it results in situation when add font proc callback trying to add process otf fonts followed by is font installed proc terminating enumeration process as soon as it encounters a font with type truetype fonttype trivial patch as i attach to this bug report workarounds the problem and makes testcase pass these tests i m not sure that there are no bad consequences in treating device fonttype fonts the same way it treats truetype fonttype in gdiplus but looking through wine s freetype font driver makes me believe that the only font type that gets assigned device fonttype is the otf format and afaik it is pretty much the same as ttf wrt its properties and capabilities another way to fix the thing is to skip fonts which have type other than truetype fonttype in add font proc callback or rewrite wine s freetype font engine driver to report truetype fonttype for otf fonts and make sure that the behavior for these font types is just the same i don t gave enough knowledge in this area so we need someone competent it this question to fix this bug ,0

WINE-10919,created attachment sizepro c a source demonstrating the problem and a solution in terms of apis msdn library includes sample code for console applications http msdn microsoft com en us library aa aspx the source is available at http www helsinki fi sund console vs zip the source compiles easily with winelib after cuiexe transformations with winemaker the examples and deal with the getlargestconsolewindowsize function the problem is that the current implementation in wine returns hard coded constants x y for the maximum size this causes problems for applications that have followed the conventions of sample code because it prevents the resizing of console window to bigger than maximum in principle the window size could be changed manually by using properties dialog but that is an ugly solution another ugly solution would be to change the hard coded constants to bigger values in wine implementation a better solution would be to actually implement the required functionality i have attached a source sizepro c compiles with winegcc o sizepro exe sizepro c that demonstrates the problem and infers the maximum console window size in relation to current resolution and font i also tried to implement the corresponding functionality to wine and attached the source for the improved function kernel console getlargestconsolewindowssize c that works fine for me but i m not sure whether it follows the conventions of wine or how to deal with strange i definitions without duplicating the code so i wonder if someone else more familiar with wine development could check it out and derive an adequate patch ,1

windowing modes fail double buffering fails for the desktop mode installing money natively to wine fails with an internal error at about the mark if you need more information just give me some basic instruction as to the debugmsg options and wine config you d like additional comments from mike theoretic com is this still a bug in latest cvs cryptoapi has been implemented for a long time now iirc it sounds like a regression or bug rather than unimplemented api additional comments from pollockd magma ca i m currently running the wine package from gentoo they also have and but these are marked

x c trace crypt cryptderivekey x fe x x f wine unhandled exception starting debugger it definitely seems to the novice s eyes that it is still failing somewhere in cryptographic code i wish i could be more help additional comments from mike theoretic com yes the trace indicates that it s failing inside the crypto code that doesn t mean it s unimplemented however i ll confirm this bug without a test app to reproduce this crash there s not much we can do to fix it unless somebody recognises this trace additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de why couldn t it be that our advapi cryptderivekey simply calls into the crypt provider dll in this case rsaenh dll function in an illegal way it s most likely cpderivekey that s called illegally since that is the only provider dll function our cryptderivekey calls btw the algorithm used is alg class data encrypt alg type stream and thus it should be rc define calg rc alg class data encrypt alg type stream alg sid rc since alg sid rc is hmm strange why is the alg id rc but the dll is called rsaenh dll maybe that is the real problem btw could you try using a different version of rsaenh dll additional comments from pollockd magma ca i m not sure how to try using a different rsaenh dll i specified the command line as wine debugmsg all dll rsaenh b msmoney exe output txt i hope that s what you wanted it didn t change the result however here s some more stuff i ve been able to find in the logs err win pe fixup imports no implementation for advapi dll cryptgetlocalkeylimits imported from c windows system rsabase dll setting to xdeadbeef i m set up to use the built in advapi implementation i ll attach my config in case there are some glaring errors that i haven t noticed just to check i tried again with both wine

no effect additional comments from pollockd magma ca created an attachment id wine configuration file additional comments from mike theoretic com hmm could you give us the full debug output rather than just the backtrace if the crash is caused by dereferencing xdeadbeef then it s probably due to the unimplemented cryptgetlocalkeylimits function i had a quick scoot around i can t find any docs on that msdn doesn t appear to have any info on it so maybe it s a callback or undocumented function additional comments from mike theoretic com this might be a dupe of bug additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de could you please try the following patch and report a debugmsg relay crypt logfile additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de created an attachment id patch to

WINE-23621,i just realized there is no bug report covering this issue directdraw surfaces and other com interfaces maintain a reference count so that they are destroyed when they are no longer in use the refcount is returned by the iunknown release function unfortunately some games base logic on the value returned by idirectdrawsurface release specifically they sometimes wrongly expect the return to be zero something like if idirectdrawsurface release surf bail out we can test this by forcing dds release to return zero one game that is affected is recoil which complains about not being to set the video mode the difference between wine s implementation and the windows implementation is windows maintains a refcount for each surface interface version and whereas wine has one reference count across all versions there are tests in dlls ddraw dsurface c that confirm the windows behaviour to fix this issue the reference counting needs to be split which requires a lot of changes as versions and all share the same thunks ,1

WINE-1265,bug comments restored from gmane org tooltip text is drastically cut off which is a big problem when working in the vfp ide as intellisense will tell a developer the syntax for the command being entered download my demo to reproduce additional comments from dclark akamail com this is being caused because this sequence of events is taking place early on the app creates two dcs for the tooltip with a default size of x pixels one is an offscreen dc for working in ends up being xa on my system and the other is the dc that is used to actually display the tooltip on the screen xa when it comes time to show the tooltip the app moves and resizes both dcs and paints and writes in the text to the offscreen dc it then copies this into the screen dc and sends a signal to make it visible up to this point everything is fine when the window is made visible some events are received from the x queue which catch up the app it sends two resize events to the offscreen dc the first resizes back to x which effectively clips the rest of the tooltip and the second resizes it back to the correct size unfortunately the contents are now corrupted but the app is assuming the offscreen dc is ok the corrupted offscreen dc is then copied to the screen dc when the tooltip is hidden and redisplayed the same sequence of events occurs except this time the dcs were already at the correct size for the tooltip so no resizing back to x occurs and the offscreen dc is not corrupted this time even when the window is closed and reopened it continues to use the dcs it has already created so no problem occurs additional comments from dclark akamail com and it looks like this patch fixes this bug i am not real sure why this code is here so will have to study more before submitting and there are already lots of patches setting in the queue already an x configurenotify event is a notification that a window has just been changed so it is not clear to me why wine immediately then changes it again i will have to test with a bunch of apps to see if i can figure out what if anything it is needed for watch out for word wrap index dlls x drv winpos c rcs file home wine wine dlls x drv winpos cv retrieving revision diff u r winpos c dlls x drv winpos c jan dlls x drv winpos c feb if nothing changed don t do anything if winpos flags swp nomove swp nosize swp nozorder swp noactivate return setwindowpos hwnd winpos hwndinsertafter winpos x winpos y winpos cx winpos cy winpos flags swp wine nohostmove setwindowpos hwnd winpos hwndinsertafter winpos x winpos y winpos cx winpos cy winpos flags swp wine nohostmove additional comments from dclark akamail com it looks like this is a much better fix index dlls x drv winpos c rcs file home wine wine dlls x drv winpos cv retrieving revision diff u r winpos c dlls x drv winpos c jan dlls x drv winpos c feb uint wvrflags bool bchangepos this is needed to flush pending x configurenotify events on this window msgwaitformultipleobjectsex null trace hwnd p swp i i i i flags x n winpos hwnd winpos x winpos y winpos x winpos cx winpos y winpos cy winpos flags additional comments from pmcnett pm sc com i didn t try your first fix but the second works this is great for visual foxpro and wine one thing though not sure if this should be a separate bug report or not if i display some tooltiptext and then switch to a different application the tooltiptext will be displaying on top of the foreground app s windows as well actually the tooltiptext will be on every desktop workspace on top of all other windows i had previously noticed this phenomenon for dockable windows that were currently undocked in the vfp ide so i m assuming this is a separate issue entirely and will likely file a separate bug report in a couple weeks additional comments from chetdude pacbell net this bug has been confirmed by popular vote additional comments from wine devel bol com br the second patch solves the bug why not to apply to current wine version and te bug appear to be resolved too additional comments from dclark akamail com hmm you assigned the bug to yourself marcelo adding wine bugs to the cc list so that further postings show up on gmane ,1

WINE-11733,under windows wxtide minimizes its main window to a system tray icon if the icon is selected as always or when minimized under wine the icon appears as controlled by the preference choices always when minimized or not at all if not selected however the main window always minimizes to its task bar entry and does not minimize the tray icon under any circumstance tested to date this is not a debilitating problem as far as using the app goes on restoring the window by clicking on its taskbar entry a window frame and appropriate decorations minimize maximize and close icons created by the window manager e g gnome or kde managers for example are drawn the interior of the window contains whatever was inside the area outlined by the window frame prior to its being drawn more importantly no tide graphs are drawn this is consistent with the app s behavior under windows where asking the app to draw again the last graph displayed is treated as a no action event from a user interface design standpoint this no action action is flawed i see no reason not to restore the same graph twice or more in a row but it s what the app s author wrote and it s not about to be changed however poor ui design is not the central issue here the central issue is simply does wine support minimize to tray and if it does why does this not happen with wxtide if minimize to tray is not presently supported development of such support seems indicated further if minimize to tray is supported under wine and doesn t happen then wxtide has encountered a bug see the attached images in bug for examples of wxtide under windows xp and under wine the workaround for the restore to an empty window problem is to use an existing popup menutied to the tray icon to open the window with any other format than the one checked in the list of four formats with the window opened and filled right click in the window and pick the original desired format which is then displayed as expected ,0

WINE-11729,hi there new unreal tournament bug after the error on exit bug was fixed this one is different however because it has to do with input the problem is that once you active direct input in the ut configuration menu and restart so the change becomes active the input sort of stops working what exactly happens i m currently not talking about being in game i m just in the menu where you land after pressing esc in the intro sequence upon pressing esc you end up with the cursor in the upper left position on the virtual windows currently using virtual desktop so debugging is easier the first entry of the game menu is opened automatically game and i can now move the cursor through the opened game entry selecting the children or i can move over to the next entry multiplayer options stat tools and select children there ok this is when dinput is off now i go into the options activate dinput and leave the game then i start the game again and encounter this upon pressing esc the cursor is still transferred to the upper left position and the menu opens what is different when clicking the menu away click on non menu components and then trying to open them again by clicking on them the menu item won t open no drop down effect i can hear the soundeffect of the menu opening but nothing more i can even click something suspecting that the menu is invisible but there so the only thing i can do is switching the app to window mode there is a button in the upper right corner that does that and then use the x button on the window to close the application another difference is that marking checkboxes doesn t work anymore i was going to make another try and restarted the app this time moving right into the config menu to deactivate input this works because esc always lets the menu pop up however removing the tick from the checkbox proved to be impossible i had to modify the unrealtournament ini to switch dinput off i created a log from the dinput run going to attach this greets tobias,1

WINE-24773,created attachment proposed patch problem description it is possible to click behind modal dialogs displayed in e g the weapon options screen this causes the modal pop up window to lose focus and go behind the weapon options screen it continues to be drawn in front on the weapon options screen however input events go to the weapon options screen instead attempting to close the weapon options screen causes the game to crash analysis it is possible to click behind certain modal dialogs because they are not disabled the reason why they are not disabled is that the mfc code which brings up a new modal dialog disables the wrong window the reason for which the wrong window is disabled is because the wine implementation of getlastactivepopup which is used by mfc to find the active dialog to disable returns an incorrect value in certain cases specifically it doesn t work correctly with nested popups the reason for that is that a new popup of an owned window doesn t update the root window s last active window as seen in wine s make window active only the immediate owner is updated attached patch test will send to wine patches ,0

WINE-20641,created attachment ms oleviewer showing the typelib on wine and windows when i tried to run a visual basic application that uses crystal reports activex control multiple problems popped up the end result was that invoking a method turns into an error that the method requested for could not be found the attached screenshots best describe the problem first screenshot shows oleviewer displaying information about the typelib for the mentioned ocx control on wine and on windows the dispatch interface crystalreportevents is not shown as being derived from idispatch and the dual types irowcursor and crystalctl as shown simply as interfaces the second screenshot shows a simple test application on wine and on windows we can see that typeinfo members returned by wine differ at many places compared to the typeinfo returned by windows of interest is the type kind for descriptions and also the no of interfaces implemented by description i have patches that fix these two problems with the patches all typeinfo members appear similar to the windows output except lcid i am posting the patches on wine patches list patch type descriptions of type kind dispatch can actually inherit from one interface instead of specifying methods and properties according to msdn the sltg parser does not seem to handle this i added code to read information about inherited interfaces in dispatch types when available patch the documentation says that dual interfaces which implement both interface and dispatch have to be returned first as dispatch types and then interface type will be returned when calls to getreftypeofimpltype and getreftypeinfo are made with index clients are supposed to check for dual flag and read the second type info accordingly however in sltg typelib above the two dual types have type kind interface set on them we must be returning dispatch type first and then later the interface so i added code to return a dual interface as dispatch type first in the sltg parser this fixes other problems such as removing the automation flag in the returned description and proper function count patch i removed a check for dispatchable flag when getreftypeofimpltype is called with index for the following reasons dual which is already being checked for implies dispatchable the sltg type library being dealt with has dual types without this flag set the flag is a computed one and not present in the idl patch updated a comment about a newly seen value in sltg typelib that was thought of to be constant after the fixes our test case using the above activex seems to run fine i ran the tests but they don t seem to contain any sltg library parsing tests ,0
