MESA-43418,when resolving the hiz buffer mesa uses the meta api with some internal gl calls however when using gles this fails because it tries to bind a renderbuffer to gl draw framebuffer but mesa asserts that this binding point is only used when the api is gl i m attaching a patch but i m not sure if it s the best solution because i ve copied the condition for whether gl draw framebuffer is allowed into gen hiz c this could be quite awkward to maintain for example if mesa ever gets support for the gl angle framebuffer blit extension then we d have to remember to change this check in two places i wonder if the check should just be removed instead mesa already lets you bind to gl draw framebuffer just not add a renderbuffer so it s already not completely validated ,1

XORG-22229,i have had some problems with flickering using this chip and high resolution displays over dvi hdmi the problem seems dependent on the model of screen some seem more sensitive to variations in pixel clock than others i have managed to resolve the issue by making changes to radeon crtc c one to enable the use of the fractional fb divider and secondly by changing the selection criteria for pll values to choose the closest frequency that is less than the target frequency rather than just the closest i have added these changes unconditionally to the driver it s basically a quick hack to make it work and certainly could be much tidier but can post a patch if required i don t have access to any other radeon cards so i can t say if this problem or the solution affects them i suspect from the looking at the commit logs that the fractional fb div doesn t work on some cards but it seems to be required for the rs any advice on how where to properly incorporate these changes into the driver would be appreciated ,0

TELEPATHY-24273,when the channel dispatcher notices that the handler for a channel has crashed it s supposed to call close on the channel this works well for text channels which respawn and just about every other type of channel which stay dead but for chat rooms this is undesirable if you re using idle through a proxy or arguably at all you don t want all your irc channels to be parted because your ui crashed the best solution seems to be to make close not leave the irc channel but make it respawn and rely on removemembers self to leave channels we can t unilaterally make this change because it breaks the semantics of close uis need to be altered to use removemembers so a boolean on the account to opt in seems like a good way but this can t ever be removed for backwards compatibility reasons reasonably high priority this is preventing some empathy tp developers dogfooding idle ,1

SYSTEMD-82347,there are a couple of arm based server systems that use the gpio keyboard and gpio keyboard polled drivers to send an event requesting a shutdown the following rules dtrt though obviously it d be nice if a more generic but still safe rule could be devised subsystem input kernel event subsystems platform kernels gpio keys program bin grep hp proliant m server cartridge proc device tree model tag power switch subsystem input kernel event subsystems platform kernels gpio keys attrs keys program bin cat proc device tree model result hp proliant m server cartridge tag power switch you ll notice a couple of differences between the two the m rule specifies a key attribute where the m rule does not this is because the first uses a polled gpio via the gpio keyboard polled driver this driver does not expose a keys attribute in sysfs the m uses the gpio keyboard driver which does you ll also notice the grep vs cat result methods not sure if upstream has a preference it might make sense to drop the model pin matching of the m rule and bind to any attr keys this is defined as key power in of course that won t help the polled variant ,1

print index limit a c dc ec f e b b ee bdf ca bab c is the first bad commit commit a c dc ec f e b b ee bdf ca bab c author roland scheidegger date thu nov gallivm fix improper clamping of vertex index when fetching gs inputs because we only have one file max for the d gs input file the value actually represents the max of attrib and vertex index although i m not entirely sure if we really want the max since the max valid value of the vertex dimension can be easily deduced from the input primitive thus in cases where the number of inputs is higher than the number of vertices per prim we did not properly clamp the vertex index which would result in out of bound fetches potentially causing segfaults the segfaults seemed actually difficult to trigger but valgrind certainly wasn t happy this might have happened even if the shader did not actually try to fetch bogus vertices if the fetching happened in non active conditional clauses to fix simply use the correct max vertex index value derived from the input prim type instead when clamping for this case reviewed by jose fonseca c db da f ddcebe c c adfcc b ded dcf a c a fb b m src bisect run success,0

SYSTEMD-75461,the latest git mastor of systemd upcoming version got some changes with regards to the handling of the situation where the lid of the laptop is closed this however has a nasty side effect as that laptops that are docked have normally their lid closed i already reported this to lennart and his indication is that this should be fixed in the kernel setting event sd dock or by the desktop environment unfortunately systemd starts already suspending the laptop during the boot process long before i reach the login manager this means that practically i can no longer boot my laptop while it is docked without opening the lid as that i have an external monitor this is a bit of a ridiculous situation i already raised a bug for the kernel but i do not expect a fast reply on that nor a fix raising a bug for the desktop environment as suggested by lennart would be strange as that no desktop environment is running at that time the only process that is in full control at that moment is systemd system boot time ,0

XORG-9943,i have an ati native xorg driver on a radeon card set up with screens as non rectangular merged xinerama with an offset specified when an application goes into fullscreen which is usually undesirable since very few applications bother to correctly identify the xinerama screen and so place themselves over the centre of the screens somewhere and then switches back out of fullscreen it leaves various things in very weird states i ll get to describing them relevant xorg conf settings mergedfb true mergedxinerama true mergednonrectangular true crt position rightof metamodes x x screen is lcd is crt definition of weird screen is left with some no go zones for the mouse but looks ok size has been restored correctly the bottom of the screen is no go and a small square in the top right of the screen is also no go screen is in the correct resloution but is suddenly got a larger virtual vertical resolution and so scrolls however apps like the kicker which hug the bottom of the screen are still left where the screen should be finishing and not at the new virtual bottom of the screen i ve also noticed possibly unrelated but happened about the same time don t ask me what version but other than that shrug that when the rhs kicker pannel is on the top of the screen and is scrolled away then i can t drag apps in the lhs screen applications past the top of the rhs screen even though maximising them works ok yakuake also drops down from the wrong spot in the lhs screen this could be a kde problem but i m including it here for completeness other than that my xorg is debian package kernel is beyond ,1

LIBREOFFICE-78477,created attachment truetype font file greetings i m using libreoffice from the backports repository of debian linux with some thousand files in my font directory which keeps growing up as i m collecting fonts since a long time ago it was possible to isolate via strace a segmentation fault in libvcllo so which prevented libreoffice from starting at all removing from fonts just a couple of fonts one is attached here they seem to belong to the same family allowed libreoffice to start flawlessly again opening the fonts with gnome font viewer allowed to see they re made only of numeric digits and some symbol which is not expected to cause a segmentation fault anyway it must be something in the file structure i m unsure about the weakness creating this problem apparently due to some poor handling of bad unexpected data if it s located in lower level components used by libvcllo so then i shall move the problem to the debian maintaners for sure if however it is due to libreoffice itself solving this problem might even close unconfirmed unreproduceable situations sharing the same cause which seems an opportunity too important to ignore is anyone capable willing to test this with other versions of libreoffice and or linux the test isn t supposed to corrupt your system if the behavior is the same i experienced then it will be sufficient to remove the offending font to get libreoffice running again thanks best regards marcello,0

POPPLER-105772,created attachment patch that prevents startpage to fill the page with white color i implemented type font support in the arthur backend loosely following what the cairo backend does it s a prototype and needs more testing but unfortunately i have only a few documents with type fonts i ll upload two patches the first removes code that made the startpage method fill the page with white color it is unclear why this code existed at all for type fonts it is problematic because then glyphs can have a white background rather than a transparent one the actual implementation it is as short as i could make it but the result is not as pretty as could be for example there are now two separate caches for type fonts and other fonts i think the best would be to introduce an abstract arthurfont base class and an arthurfontengine cc file similar to what the cairo backend does i ll promise to provide this as a separate cleanup patch once the type support has been merged ,0

TELEPATHY-27795,created attachment patch to add operator and qhash when you try to use a sharedptr in a qmap as follows qmap int the compiler will happily allow you to do so however when running the application you ll notice some strange behavior note that qmap like std map requires that the type used for a key have operator defined in order to determine the order of th eelements in the map tp qt does not provide operator for sharedptrs so the compiler looks for a suitable comparison operator and notices that sharedptr can be implicitly converted to bool due to the unfortunate definition of sharedptr operator bool and so it uses the following operator to determine element order operator bool a bool b so when you insert a new element into the map it will compare the new key with the old key by first converting them to booleans the impact of this is that any non null sharedptr will be interpreted as being the exact same key value this means that the maximum number of elements in this map is one non null sharedptr and one null sharedptr a user can define an appropriate operator herslef but it s not immediately obvious that this is necessary it would be good if the library itself provided the comparison operator i m providing a patch that adds a few comparison operators and a qhash implementation for sharedptr note that this does not fix all of the unfortunate consequences of defining the operator bool since the following line will still happily compile despite it being quite obviously nonsense int i sharedptr new t but that s a different bug report ,1

WAYLAND-82742,environment embedded linux device resistive touch screen latest weston wayland and libinput summary calibrated values are based on pixels and are used to compensate for differences in touch screens libinput receives raw touch values on an resistive touchscreen these are based on adc values with a range ex libinput then uses the calibrated values to adjust the raw touch values these adjusted values are then passed to weston which eventually converts the adjusted values to actually screen coordinates pixels however when calculating the screen coordinates these adjusted values results in very large values greater the screen dimension or negative values to be returned when weston sends these coordinates values to the rest of the system no interaction with views can take place since the incorrect touch coordinates are beyond the screen thus no interaction can ever take place so before any raw values are adjusted via calibration they should first be converted to screen coordinates pixels this is how weston without libinput handles things and touch works fine more details can be found in this mailing list thread http lists freedesktop org archives wayland devel august html,0

XDG-USER-DIRS-36773,created attachment patch we currently create it with permissions which is wrong the spec clearly says if when attempting to write a file the destination directory is non existant an attempt should be made to create it with permission i m wondering if we should fix the permissions for existing account the spec mentions if the destination directory exists already the permissions should not be changed but i m afraid that many apps might be doing the same mistake so it might be worth just forcing this especially as some apps put passwords in xdg config home same thing for xdg data home for which we could also fix the permissions at the same time ,0

DBUS-99828,on windows the server side of the nonce tcp transport creates a randomly named file with random contents the nonce in the temporary directory returned by gettemppatha which is user specific in all non obsolete versions of windows this is fine because gettemppatha is user specific we only have to care about accidents not malice on unix it creates a randomly named permissions directory in the temporary directory in practice usually tmp then creates a file named nonce with random contents in that directory this would be fine if we used mkdir and checked for eexist the worst that could happen would be that someone could cause dos by filling the directory with lots of files or directories of the form we wanted to use which we could mitigate with a retry loop if we cared enough however we use dbus create directory which unexpectedly treats eexist as success this means an attacker could arrange for us to write into a directory they can read or could arrange for us to write into a directory containing a symlink named nonce pointing to a file they want to overwrite this is technically a security vulnerability so i m initially filing this as a closed off bug however there are mitigations dbus daemon on unix does not allow nonce tcp by default nonce tcp on network transports other than loopback is trivially insecure anyway because anyone on the local lan can read the nonce from tcp traffic prior to dbus and nonce tcp didn t work on unix due to bug nonce tcp is a semi pointless layering violation because on ordinary tcp connections we use dbus cookie sha to do authentication and nonce tcp is just an extra layer of security theatre around that i think the reasoning for it might have been that before bug was fixed d bus on windows used to pretend all connections had successfully credentials passed i am the same uid as you which was clearly wrong but made external authentication work even though it should have failed so i m very tempted to make this a public bug fix it in master and move on perhaps without doing a round of stable releases opinions we should keep nonce tcp working on windows because it s what people expect and we should keep at least basic functionality on linux so that we can have test coverage but i think it s ok if it ceases to work on other unixes secondary related issue the embedded tests have similarly insecure behaviour in init service reload test in init service reload test it s worse because we even try to delete re create an existing directory with some time of check time of use fun but we always tell people that the embedded tests are not meant to be compiled into a production dbus build anyway being only a developer thing so i think this one is clearly just a bug i would be tempted to make this test require that a trusted directory we own is passed in via the environment do its writing there instead of in tmpdir and skip that part of the test if the environment variable isn t set make check would make sure to set it to something that s in the builddir follow up actions this makes me want to revisit the idea of hard coding dbus daemon x so that on unix it will refuse to listen on non af unix transports or carry out non external authentication people can still use dbusserver if they want to construct a fast but insecure d bus proxy it also makes me tempted to try to delete dbus get tmpdir if we ever try to use it without using mkdtemp or mkstemp we are probably wrong i d be happy with nonce tcp ceasing to work on platforms that don t have mkdtemp in libc i only want it on unix at all so i can have some level of confidence that it works ,0

MESA-27962,the x server implementation of glx checks the drawables event mask before sending glx bufferswapcomplete events but when direct rendering we convert dri bufferswapcomplete events into the glx events and the dri events are sent unconditionally so application always receives events even when it hasn t asked for them this certainly violates the expectations of the extension spec and could confuse applications probably dri eventtowire should silently consume the events without delivering them this would mean saving the event mask client side ,1

XORG-8001,i m so very happy no embargo date as yet quoting idefense local exploitation of an integer overflow vulnerability in the cidafm function in the x org and xfree x server could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with privileges of the x server typically root the vulnerability specifically exists in the cidadm function of the code responsible for handling afm adobe font metrics files the number of character metrics is obtained from the startcharmetrics line of an afm file and that value is then multiplied by the size of a single character metric record in order to calculate the space required to store the metrics if the result of the multiplication is larger than the largest value that can be held in an integer the amount actually allocated will be much smaller following this the function attempts to read as many metric records as were specified on the line into that memory as the contents of the file can be specified by a local user and as the function will stop reading if an error is detected in the input a controlled heap overflow may occur which may allow the execution of arbitrary code ,0

MESA-31194,the documentation for gldeleteprogram says that if the program to be deleted is currently bound then it won t actually be deleted until another program is selected the mesa meta code tries to save and restore most of the gl state before using gl calls to do some operations including saving the gl program however it just stores the gl program number and then calls gluseprogram to disable it if gldeleteprogram was already called on this program then this will end up freeing the program when the meta code later tries to restore the state gluseprogram will throw a gl error because the saved program number is no longer valid attached is an example program demonstrating the bug it creates a fragment shader which just sets the fragment color to green it makes the program current and then immediately deletes it it then draws two quads while the program is active but it calls gldrawpixels in between gldrawpixels ends up using the meta save restore code which causes the program to be deleted so the second quad ends up red ,0

LIBREOFFICE-43259,i have four big irritations with the behaviour of the installer which as far as i know have all been present since before libreoffice forked from openoffice the windows installation program for libreoffice starts by asking where to save unpacked files the user has to choose a location then has to click the unpack button the default location offered is on the user s desktop once the installation is complete the directory to which the files were unpacked is left in place this directory is used only for the installation not for running any of the libreoffice programs the need for this directory is therefore temporary it does not make sense to a use the user s desktop for a temporary directory b ask the user to choose the location of a temporary directory given that all operating systems provide directories for this purpose c label the unpack button as such such a term may be meaningless to less computer literate users something like continue would be a better choice of word d leave the temporary directory intact after the installation it should automatically be deleted the only situation in which it would make sense to ask the user for the location of a temporary directory would be when there is insufficient disc space in the filesystem that holds the operating system designated default temporary directory in such a case the installation program could offer the choice of a directory in a filesystem that it has calculated has sufficient free space i can think of no other application installation program that does not tidy up after itself by deleting a temporary directory and the files it contains unless we go back perhaps years after unpacking the next interaction is to ask for the user s name and organisation this question is asked even when upgrading from an older version for which this question will have previously been answered why does the installer not read the configuration of the older version to obtain this information the installation program creates the appropriate start menu folder and entries it names the folder with the major and minor version numbers e g libreoffice if the system has been upgraded from a previous major or minor version the start menu folder for that version e g libreoffice is not deleted it should be the entries in libreoffice s start menu folder all begin with the word libreoffice e g libreoffice base libreoffice calc surely this word is superfluous since they are entries in a folder named libreoffice this is not just a cosmetic issue it means that the user cannot start impress for example simply by pressing the i key in this menu folder instead you need multiple presses of the l or down arrow keys followed by return i feel these issues add up to making libreoffice look far less professional than it deserves ,1

LIBREOFFICE-77057,on the microsoft forums a number of users reported that the photos app in windows no longer worked it would show folders of photos but it wouldn t display the actual photos it would just say that the folders were empty this turned out to be related to this registry key hkey local machine software microsoft windows currentversion explorer kindmap listed under that key are file extensions affected users noted that the keys for all image file extensions had been changed from picture to document which is what caused the bug in the photos app manually changing the value of each affected key back to picture and then rebuilding the search index fixes the issue this issue affected of my machines so i posted a list of the software that s installed on both which includes libreoffice another user also reported that he had libreoffice installed so that started to look like the likely culprit so i then uninstalled libreoffice entirely on doing so all photo file extensions were removed from the kindmap altogether i then reinstalled the latest version of libreoffice and all of the photo extensions were added back into the kindmap but they were all set to document which again breaks the photos app it appears that the bug has elements then installing libreoffice changes the registry keys for image file extensions in the kindmap from picture to document breaking functionality in windows including microsoft s standard photos app uninstalling libreoffice remove the registry keys for image file extensions completely from the kindmap which causes the photos app in windows to fail to display thumbnails and it may have other unwanted effects thanks ,1

FONTCONFIG-17014,created attachment reduce number of allocations during fcsortwalk the current behaviour of fcsortwalk is to create a new fccharset on each iteration that is the union of the previous iteration with the next fccharset in the font set this causes the existing fccharset to be reproduced in its entirety and then allocates fresh leaves for the new fccharset in essence the number of allocations is quadratic wrt the number of fonts required by introducing a new method for merging a new fccharset with an existing one we can change the behaviour to be effectively linear with the number of fonts allocating no more leaves than necessary to cover all the fonts in the set for example profiling gedit utf demo txt allocator nallocs nbytes before fccharsetfindleafcreate fccharsetputleaf after fccharsetfindleafcreate fccharsetputleaf the savings are even more significant for applications like firefox b which need to switch between large number of fonts before fccharsetfindleafcreate fccharsetputleaf after fccharsetfindleafcreate fccharsetputleaf just to need to verify that the output of fcsortwalk is not changed ,1

LIBREOFFICE-88339,description when you attempt to move an image png jpg in lo rc the image is moved as if you are holding down shift it tries to lock onto the original image location s horizontal vertical diagonal axes holding down shift while moving the image returns the original expected behavior this affects moving images in draw impress and calc but not writer i guess i ll choose draw as the component steps to reproduce create new drawing insert an image jpg or png attempt to move the image towards a corner expected the image s movement should be fully within your control you should have fine grained control over where to place the image actual the image jerks back to be aligned with the original location s axes it behaves exactly like you are holding down the shift key to constrain movement you can even hold down shift to return to the normal movement behavior my guess is that this change was not intentional and was made as part of s move to constrain image s aspect ratio by default but movement should not be constrained by default this one is quite annoying i bibisected e f a b e d cb a e b b is the first bad commit commit e f a b e d cb a e b b author bjoern michaelsen date thu nov source hash d f b a bc b ea a a c d commit d f b a bc b ea a a c d author toma vajngerl authordate thu sep commit toma vajngerl commitdate fri sep android log number of invalidated tiles change id i ebfcf f d a b d bf c c be cb f d eca c c f de fd ebb dc e e eca b fcfc b d m autogen log aa bbbc d c f a e fc a e cea c ab fde cd e ec m ccache log eb fe cb fd ff fa a eec e d df b fb cc d f m commitmsg d fd a cce ea c e e a a be e e cfa dea cc a a edb a m make log ea c b f f de a eaa d e e ba bbe f fbeee ae ed b m opt git bisect log git bisect start latest oldest good d dfb e ae a f c d e c e source hash c cd de f f f bf dcc ea git bisect good d dfb e ae a f c d e c e good dfacd b bd d c f de e bc e a source hash f ce f eb d ea d a c dbd git bisect good dfacd b bd d c f de e bc e a bad a da cd fca ba cce c b fc a source hash beadebc f eb fcb dcb d afdf git bisect bad a da cd fca ba cce c b fc a bad f ca f e f e a source hash f a a d eb d b git bisect bad f ca f e f e a bad b b a b b ffa fc e source hash a cd e d f bfab af f git bisect bad b b a b b ffa fc e good b c b d ac bd d source hash da f da dc a ea bc dc decf bc git bisect good b c b d ac bd d bad e f a b e d cb a e b b source hash d f b a bc b ea a a c d git bisect bad e f a b e d cb a e b b good de a e a f ba e c fd fde c source hash fd a bdd cf d feff d b fbe fdc git bisect good de a e a f ba e c fd fde c first bad commit e f a b e d cb a e b b source hash d f b a bc b ea a a c d ,0

FONTCONFIG-4763,cut from my mail hi i vote for adding embeddedbitmap option to official fontconfig several distros have shiped patched version of fontconfig which adds an option like rh prefer bitmap or embeddedbitmap because we need a way to explictly tell xft cairo to load bitmaps embedded in fonts or not and for cairo if i want to cairo transform a font to pretend as an oblique one and when i disable antialias for the font then cairo will always load embedded bitmaps if available latter cairo exactly to say it s freetype will be unable to transform the font glyphs because they are bitmaps if option embeddedbitmap is available we can tell freetype to load outlines rather than embedded bitmaps by set embeddedbitmap to false and then can transform font glyphs as expected xft is smart enough in this case it add fc load no bitmap to load flags when loading glyphs but that is not easily to implement in cairo because cairo doesn t handle fc matrix itself ,1

WAYLAND-78190,currently the wl surface protocol requires damage to be reported in surface coordinates however since egl is unaware of any buffer to surface transformations that may have been applied through set buffer transform set buffer scale or wl viewport it cannot report damage correctly in short the egl implementation has no way of knowing about buffer transformations the egl implementation is responsible to call wl surface damage inside of eglswapbuffers because it doesn t know about buffer transformations it can t damage a rectangle the same size as the surface mesa currently damages an area of int max x int max to deal with this however in the version of the specification the surface size was always the same as buffer size some egl implementations including older versions of mesa rely on this and only damage the buffer size therefore damage is wrong if the surface is rotated by or degrees clients have no way to determine if the egl stack they are using does max damage or simply damages the buffer area therefore they cannot assume that the egl implementation will do the right thing especially since this used to be perfectly ok this also means that they can t detect whether or not surface transformations are useable it turns out that damage isn t an issue in the case where we have an integer buffer scale or a transform that s a multiple of degress this is because in these cases the buffer size is at least as large as the surface size and damaging bigger isn t a problem using wl viewport to scale up a surface however does coause a problem as far as i see it this leaves us with four options clients call wl surface damage manually right before eglswapbuffers the surface would always get damaged by eglswapbuffers as well while the surface would probably get over damaged it would at least ensure enough damage we add an egl extension for every type of surface transformation we say that any egl implementation that does not damage an area of int max x int max is broken and hope they change we change the protocol so damage is in buffer coordinates option breaks the whole idea of eglswapbuffers and hiding stuff inside of eglsurface and is really messy option is bad because we don t want to wait on egl implementations before clients can use new protocol bits in my initial discussions with kristian on irc he was a much bigger fan of and trying to hack around things in clients initially we thought that we could just avoid and degree rotations unless we have egl ext swap buffers with damage the idea was that eglswapbufferswithdamageext would simply pass the damage rectangles through to the compositor so it is then up to the client to hand it the right damage and buffer transforms would then be ok unfortunately egl ext swap buffers with damage is even more broken than eglswapbuffers in some sense when the egl ext swap buffers with damage extension was written the authors trying to stay consistent with the rest of opengl chose to make the coordinates of the damage rectangles relative to the lower left corner of the surface rather than the upper left this means that the egl implementation has to vertically flip all of the damage rectangles normally this is a trivial operation however if the egl implementation does not know the proper height of the surface the computed rectangles will be wrong this means that not only is eglswapbuffers broken but eglswapbufferswithdamage is broken even worse unless we start re writing egl extensions i think we re stuck with option ,1

XORG-2262,for most locales there doesn t seem to be more than one notation of writing we match locale names against a list in locale alias to find the name of the directory where the locale info resides having this list contain every reasonable combination of upper and lower case writing and inclusion would make this list rather long the patch that i m about to attach will attempt to normalize the locale name ie it will remove any and and convert any character to lower case after the part this patch needs to be tested thoroughly and possible there are reasons that speak against using it ,1

XORG-1101,when a child widget of a redirected window has a background pixmap set the background pixmap is painted with the wrong origin the origin of the redirected window rather than that of the child widget i ve created a simple testcase that creates a x window then creates and sets a background pixmap for the window the background pixmap has the same size as the window and is white with a black outline and an x drawn across it if you start the application without a composite manager running the window is rendered correctly but as soon as you start xcompmgr any mode you ll see the background redrawn with the origin of the window manager frame rather than that of the client window this bug affects multiple kde applications but only when composite is enabled and a composite manager is running it s possible this is the same problem as reported in bug ,0

DRI-76531,most recent testing rc mainline as suggested on irc by imirkin returning ebusy instead of einval from nouveau pmops runtime suspend avoids driver to fall too far to the ground when returning einval connectors get being seen as disconnected and there is no way to get them connected anymore when returning ebusy the connectors stay functional but de enlightenment complains about missing crtc and all that is visible is black background and a cursor that response to mouse trackpad way to reproduce have xorg running then for each avtive output call xrandr output output off when last output got marked off runtime suspend kicks in same similar behavior has been observed on radeon i don t remember the exact kernel releases but older ones got console to display when switching vts while newer failed to do so ,1

XORG-8085,the most often encountered manifestation of this bug is this if you change the setting of both the key and the edge activating an action the edge setting is reset to the default the value set up during the initialization of the corresponding plugin when compiz restarts this bug has been discussed in several topics of compiz net forums because it manifests itself by breaking settings of several plugins one of the discussions http www compiz net topic html contains steps to reproduce the bug with the scale plugin http www compiz net viewtopic php pid p the bug has been reported analyzed and two solutions a long term one and a transitional one has been proposed in compiz net bugtracker at http bugs compiz net view php id a copy some bits from there follows ulph s analysis of the issue when gconfinitoption is called for an option of type compoptiontypeaction there are four calls to gconfgetoptionvalue with the entries for key button bell and edge in that order suppose gconfgetoptionvalue is called for the key entry and that the key entry is set in gconf now gconfgetoptionvalue will locate the data structure for the action this data structure holds the configuration for both key button bell and edge next gconfgetoptionvalue will update the data structure to reflect the key configuration for that action finally it will call gconfsetdisplayoptionforplugin that will notify the plugin of the change and write back the action to gconf with gconfsetoption since gconfsetoption writes back the entire action data structure to gconf the button bell and edge keys that haven t been read into our action data structure yet will be overwritten ulph s long term proposal i propose that the gconf structure should be changed so that actions are in separate directories where all entries are read and written at once that way it would be easy to distinguish an action from some other key the current way that actions are retreived from gconf is kind of awkward also this problem would be easier to resolve do you think this is a good idea my crankyjack s transitional proposal putting actions into separate directories is logical plus it will make them look much neater in gconf editor the trouble is that this change is almost as big as the move to the action system was it will break current settings and requires new gconf schemas so plan b would be to change gconfgetoptionvalue so that it loads the four action options together the change could be done as follows move the ugly heuristics which determines plugin and option name in lines of gconfgetoptionvalue to gconfkeychanged merge gconfinitoption and the remainder of gconfgetoptionvalue into a new function gconfgetoption it should take the same arguments as gconfinitoption and load actions as a single entity the function will have to synthesize the gconf path to keys the initial part of gconfinitoption and call gconf client get entry call the new gconfgetoption from gconfkeychanged and replace calls to gconfinitoption with gconfgetoption i think this makes sense because gconfgetoption will do what its name says and will better mirror gconfsetoption what it does in the current state is better described as gconfgetkey moreover the function will not change much when later actions will get separate gconf directories ,1

MESA-97291,created attachment shaders with faulty and non faulty versions i m the main developer of ogre our shaders produce incorrect results on mesa we always use std i believe the problem is caused by incorrect packing of structs it s am now so i couldn t double check yet i am attaching the vertex shader and pixel shader the main and only difference between the two is that one does shadow mapping the other one doesn t the one doing shadow mapping just glitches by glitches i mean colours are washed out as if lighting was really wrong or just black this happens with all of our samples where shadow mapping is done i believe this is caused by our unusual struct definition struct shadowreceiverdata mat texviewproj vec shadowdepthrange vec invshadowmapsize struct light vec position vec diffuse vec specular vec attenuation vec spotdirection vec spotparams layout binding uniform passbuffer vertex shader common to both receiver and casters mat viewproj vertex shader mat view shadowreceiverdata shadowrcv this is not in the good shader pixel shader mat invviewmatcubemap float pssmsplitpoints not present in the good shader float pssmsplitpoints not present in the good shader float pssmsplitpoints not present in the good shader light lights pass glxinfo grep version server glx version string client glx version string glx version max core profile version max compat profile version max gles profile version max gles profile version opengl core profile version string core profile mesa opengl core profile shading language version string opengl version string mesa opengl shading language version string opengl es profile version string opengl es mesa opengl es profile shading language version string opengl es glsl es opengl renderer string gallium on amd cape verde drm llvm i own a radeon hd gb may worth noting this bug also happens on sw rasterizer because the exact same output can be seen on a virtual machine i m attached the shaders both under good and bad folder i m guessing you re gonna need more information from me so let me know what i m missing ideally i would have time to track this down to the exact variable in the wrong offset but i don t have the time and it s am already you probably should add our samples to your testing suite a lot of them don t work with mesa and would help improve mesa greatly our code can be found at https bitbucket org sinbad ogre src dc e d b d f d c c ef at v pso i can provide assistance compiling our samples or binary blobs if it s too much hassle just as an example this is how our pbssample is supposed to look http imgur com lcnz h this is how mesa renders it incorrectly http imgur com sfosbgy this is how mesa correctly renders it when shadows are disabled note in the pbs sample there are lights but when shadows are disabled ogre will only use light http imgur com ms i y in other samples activating shadow mapping just results in zero my best guess is bad offset calculation have fun ,0

WAYLAND-102385,we have a system with two touchscreens connected and a modified weston based on release libinput is the two touch devices are aggregated into a single wl seat in weston we need to be able to do touchscreen calibration on the fly by user request without restarting weston and keep the existing calibration across reboots as we do not have a protocol extension for touchscreen calibration there is a calibration script that clears the existing calibration flushes the calibration in udev uses udev api for force remove and re add the touchscreen input device launches weston calibrator refreshes the calibration matrix in udev and uses udev api for force remove and re add the touchscreen input device in question this force remove and re add triggers weston to re read the calibration from udev as only one touch device is force removed at a time the wl seat never loses the touch capability in our case the following process is enough to trigger this place finger on touchscreen run udevadm trigger c remove s input name match dev input event this being out touchscreen input device remove finger run udevadm trigger c add s input name match dev input event note touchscreen is unresponsive if there is a touch down on the touch device at the time of its forced removal weston s drm backend does not relay the required touch up events to weston core to update the touch down counts this leaves weston core to believe there is a touch down which cannot be released anymore leading to essentially dead touchscreen based on the irc discussion with peter hutterer the issue of the missing touch ups might be a race in libinput or not this bug report is to figure out if there would be anything to fix in libinput or should weston do something different quoting peter if i can reproduce it with a delayed libinput dispatch then i ll fix it in libinput for sure because that s what we promise it was tested once that if one physically unplugs the touch device from usb while a finger is down then the touch up came as it should ,0

XORG-22232,i m not sure which component affected to my bug report for first lets attach it to xkeyboard confg package i have notebook macbook pro with linux on board it works perfectly except some small issues one issue related to keyboard that is default keys map is not so good you can check how macbook pro keyboard look like http support apple com kb ht as normal usage i prefer to have several keys map i prefer to switch left alt key with left windows key super l map small enter key kpen with delete key and either eject to print key here the list super l to alt l alt l to super l kp enter to delete eject to print first two rules can be done easily by using layout options in gnome keyboard property application for two last rules i made my own layout options i map enter to delete key with no problems but when i made rules for eject key it wont work when i press eject key it appear as print key in xev application my gnome keyboard shortcut set to run print screen application but when i press eject key on my workspace noting happens i also tried to map other key to check if it my fault or not when i map kp enter to print key everything works fine but when i map eject to print noting going to work in my opinion here bug in x but i do not know where it is here is my patch for it ,1
MESA-106246,created attachment volund benchmark sh hello a general issue encountered in dxvk is that pipelines have to be compiled at draw time as the pipeline state and the combination of shaders used for rendering are not known in advance this leads to noticable stutter in a lot of games when the shader cache is cold the attached script measures the pipeline compile times of the unity blacksmith demo which can be downloaded here https blogs unity d com releasing the blacksmith i picked this demo because it warms the shader cache as part of its loading process making for a reproducible test case on my ryzen x setup all the vkcreategraphicspipelines calls combined take about four minutes using the higher preset on mesa llvm and latest dxvk master where about rds of the total cpu time is spent inside llvm and th inside libvulkan radeon an optimization i have in mind for dxvk would be to use vk pipeline create disable optimization bit in order to reduce the initial compile times and to compile an optimized version of the pipeline asynchronously in the background however this requires driver support for vk pipeline create disable optimization bit please let me know if this is a viable option and if significant gains are to be expected when implementing support for this flag in the driver ,1

PULSEAUDIO-93285,if a client fails to initialise the srb channel then it will throw a protocol error and refuse to continue this is very undesirable as the srb channel requires some glibc and kernel features that the client might not have support for the protocol doesn t clearly specify how the client can opt out of srb support except possibly limiting itself to version of the protocol but that s not really a long term solution looking at the code it seems like the server can deal just fine with the client never ack ing the pa command enable srbchannel so that s what i ve done in our end for now diff git a src pulse context c b src pulse context c index ea c a src pulse context c b src pulse context c static void handle srbchannel memblock pa context c pa memblock memblock pa memblock ref memblock sr pa srbchannel new from template c mainloop if sr pa context fail c pa err protocol pa log warn failed to enable srb channel c srb template readfd c srb template writefd pa memblock unref c srb template memblock c srb template memblock null return not sure if this is the correct long term approach a nack in the protocol would have been nice though as to why this happens we are compiling and shipping our own pulseaudio that will talk to the local pulseaudio via tunnel new but we have to be compatible with all kinds of old crap out there so we cannot compile against a glibc new enough to have eventfd hence have sys eventfd h is not set and it will always fail to create a srb channel ,1

DRI-97354,created attachment journal log with kernel using intel driver i have a desktop machine intel ivybridge dq kb and running arch linux after update to kernel with the usual pacman syu my desktop initially boots up fine and presents the sddm greeter screen as normal but when logging in the usual splash screen appears on the monitor with the progress bar moving across but at around through this process the plasma login seems hangs for many seconds eventually the splash screen disappears and i end up with just the desktop background image but no taskbar and the mouse becomes active again after being unavailable whilst the progress bar and splash are on the screen once the mouse is active again and i can select the usual options with right click including the logout option rebooting makes no difference and logging out and back in also makes no difference downgrading the kernel back to arch allows my plasma desktop to login normally again so this looks like a possible bug in the kernel intel driver i ran some more tests if i update to kernel and then remove the xf video intel package and remove the file etc x xorg conf d intel conf so that the system uses the modesetting driver instead of the intel driver then the system boots to a normal graphical sddm login screen and logging in completes to give a normal plasma desktop including the taskbar however the kickoff menu opens in a strange way with it seems items off the left of the screen so that they are not accessible also if i start the chrome browser it appears to start but is not on the screen again possibly it is trying to place the chrome window outside of the screen area so although the graphics partly works it is not usable the versions of key packages are xorg server xorg xf video intel ga a xorg drivers xorg ,1

DBUS-92028,i recently tried to build dbus from the dbus branch with cmake and run dbus daemon exe session which fails with the message failed to start message bus address autolaunch already used after a switch to dbus branch followed by a recompile a run with the same command line does not fail dbus verbose prints out the lines below which may give a hint about the root cause what i can see is that

LIBREOFFICE-36551,it s not possible without dirty tricks to update a installation of libreoffice to the beta because of unfortunate naming of packages there are versioned package names that install files to non versioned directories both core as well as extension packages are affected for example opt libreoffice program kdefilepicker is in package libreoffice core and libreoffice core as both have a different name the libreoffice core is not considered an update of libreoffice core thus rpm as well as dpkg try to install the beta one alongside of the one and of course fails because both packages include the same files the same filepaths it s a bad idea to have versioned package names when they use a non versioned directory the only way to do a clean update in this case is to add tons of obsoletes statements in all affected packages two ways to solve this dilemma allow packages to installed along each other except the desktop integration one you have to decide which version should be in your de s menu what should be default for the corresponding mime types in this case make the installation directory versioned as well opt libreoffice for example have be an update to previous version s in this case remove the version from the package names and add a corresponding obsoletes to the packages or put a hard break to it without adding obsoletes directive and make manual uninstallation of previous versions mandatory for the users by putting it in big letter to the release notes note that neither of the above is a replacement for special development versions that can always be inside alongside release candidate versions like bug requests ,0

XORG-24278,when we add a file to the distribution automake does not know about so it is not removed automatically by distclean we should have a line in the makefile distcleanfiles changelog when running distcheck to verify the tarballs it performs a vpath build in a temporary build directory it then proceeds to clean it and verify it is empty to do that it invokes the distcleancheck a command that is only available from a vpath build this command would normally print out an error because of changelog still being present the distcheck target then removes the whole vpath build it doesn t print an error at the moment because the changelog cmd macro has overwritten the distcleancheck code to ignore the changelog file in the context of distcheck it does not matter because the whole temp build is removed right after there are issues with overriding distcleancheck listfiles it is not scalable if we generate other files that need to be cleaned the changelog cmd would need to know about it which makes no sense only the error is suppressed the file is not removed when running autoreconf wall a warning is emitted about the fact that distcleancheck code has been overwritten given that there is a clean solution which does not have any of the issues above we should update the makefile appropriately a side note about the generated tar files when creating a vpath build so we can see what is going on during a distcheck you will notice an error about the tar files left in the directory this is an inconsistency in automake the distcheck target does explicitly remove the tar files before running distcleancheck so we don t see an error message when running distcheck this is not an issue for us ,1

LIBREOFFICE-63141,created attachment odt example created with libo since libo all headings of my files saved with prior libo version looked smaller it still happens with libo i could not realize what was happening until today that i downloaded libo and didn t use the translated ui i will try to describe the problem carefully attaching a odt file and screenshots system kubuntu with libo installed from repositories description the first screenshot shows a file created with libo installed from kubuntu repos all formating is done through styles so the header has a the header style translated as encabezamiento en libo and prior headings has their conrresponding heading styles encabezados and so for bodytext the styles used in this file are encabezado heading liberation sans pts encabezados heading of heading pts encabezamiento header pts the second screenshot shows this file opened with libo without the spanish translation it shows a correct formating of the file with exactly the same styles as defined in files saved with libo the third screenshot shows the same file opened with libo but having already installed the translated ui now the styles has become encabezado heading liberation sans pts as was header encabezados heading of heading pts encabezamiento header doesn t exist so the problem is that the spanish translation is using header in place of heading when saving this file with libo with spanish ui opening with lib looks also wrong with the modified styles ,1

WAYLAND-99703,on macos and windows when you move the cursor around at high enough speed an accidental second finger touch on the trackpad does not stop the cursor instead the second finger is ignored and cursor movement continues this is very comfortable as it allows one to rest fingers on the trackpad while doing large mouse movements e g crossing the screen linux however immediately switches to two finger touch i e scroll as soon as you touch the trackpad irrespective of current cursor speed this results in frequent inconvenient accidental missed targets or random scrolls where the intent was really mouse movement this is especially annoying for people who switch back and forth between linux and other platforms if the cursor is presently moving at high enough speed it is unlikely that the person wants to immediately convert that movement to fast scrolling in the same direction it seems much more likely that the second finger is simply touching the trackpad because it s a natural resting position suggestion define a speed threshold above which an incoming second touch is ignored this could be an option if some people really prefer the current behaviour ,1

DBUS-27110,hi this is a series of patches porting dbus daemon to windows ce using cegcc cross compilation under gnu linux as windows ce only provides a limited subset of the windows api and an even more minimal and broken subset of the posix ish windows api i approached this port in the following way convert the existing windows port fully to the windows api replacing remnants of unix ish interfaces open mkdir readdir etc by their windows ish counterparts createfile createdirectory findnextfile etc the advantage is that this makes the port more uniform and also avoids confusion for example posixish checking of return values of windowsish interfaces as happened for movefileexa if you are not with me on this design decision the whole set of patches needs to be abandonend or rather reworked the alternative i can think of is implementing the posixish interfaces for windows ce but that may be messy as this may conflict with what s there already please let me know if you feel strongly about this i have isolated the changes to the windows port in a first patch this patch is tested not to break the windows build the unit tests dbus test complete successfully and a kde program still works issues addresses are among others use of windows api instead of posixish apis indirect use of errno which does not exist in windows ce and needs to be replaced by set getlasterror the second patch makes more code that depends on signal h and locale h conditional these header files and associated interfaces simply don t exist on windows ce the third patch adds windows ce detection to configure in and also adjusts the winsock library it s lws on ce instead of lws on nt nobody seems to know why this is different the fourth patch then fulfills the promise of the patch and implements the parts of the windows api that are missing on windows ce notably it provides wrappers for the ascii variants of the interfaces as windows ce only has unicode interface variants the alternative to switch the dbus code base to unicode is too invasive for this port but would make large parts of this patch obsolete the fifth patch is an unfortunate work around for a discrepancy of the windows nt and windows ce command line parser in the wrapper around main windows standard is to have winmain as entry point which gets a command line string that is then parsed by the application windows ce and nt have different ideas how to break the cmdline into strings for argv in particular windows nt expects the first component of the cmdline to be the program name argv while windows ce gets the program name from the modulename and expects the first component of the cmdline to be the first argument argv the sixth patch ports the dbus monitor c program from tools the seventh patch adds a readme wince to the root directory with further information on the port the eighth patch includes a patched version of libtool for the build current versions of libtool unfortunately don t support windows ce cross builds correctly the libtool wrapper programs do not compile for this platform and there is an error in the detection order note that this patch would become obsolete by upgrading to an upcoming working libtool version our changes needed for wince have been submitted and accepted upstream i also have a port of the dbus launch tool in the works but i want to clear the queue before cleaning that up i will append it to this bug report shortly ,1

LIBREOFFICE-33370,regarding libo rc linux x install deb en us readmes readme en us i suggest a change from sudo dpkg i deb the above dpkg command does the first part of the installation process to complete the process you also need to install the desktop integration packages to do this change directory to the desktop integration directory that is within the debs directory using the following command cd desktop integration now run the dpkg command again sudo dpkg i deb to something like the following commands will install libreoffice and the desktop integration packages you may just copy and paste them into the terminal screen rather than trying to type them sudo dpkg i deb cd desktop integration sudo dpkg i deb the purpose for the change is to make it easier for the user to perform the install by having the three command together a single copy paste can be used which reduces the chance for typos or other errors it also improves the visibility of the actual commands the user is to enter thus making the install faster along with easier ,1
CAIRO-48395,bitmap font rendering in gtk applications is slow with cairo and for example gvim and dina font leads to slow build up of the screen compared to qvim qt or gvim with a ttf font the same problem also occurs for xfce terminal but not in urxvt in htop it shows that xorg goes to high cpu load when making changes on the screen with cairo xcb from aur arch user repositories this problem does not occur steps to reproduce opening gvim with a bitmap font like dina shows a slow buildup of the screen also making changes like toggling nerdtree or adding or removing menu toolbars are slow it is also visible when switching to a desktop with gvim open the problem is more obvious when the app window is larger perhaps the general section is not the right place but i did not know which backend this might be related to ,0
