WINE-12097,as seen on http pf krakow sdi tpnet pl wine transl we have a lot of out of sync resources sometimes it s menus missing only a separator and some of them are probably false positives e g korean dialogs declares a font while english doesn t but they probably need to to have korean characters however it would be good to have a confirmation but often these are missing menu items or stringtable entries this can lead to shell folders like my documents not to be created or empty strings like in http www winehq org pipermail wine devel attachments a add app png i think as wine should be a stable release we shouldn t ship such resources we could try e g to add an options to wrc to copy missing strings from english stringtables while for other resources surround them by ifdef include broken resources that wouldn t be set when compiling wine but would be used be used by the statistic scripts to notify the translators about broken resources another solution would be to use something like the po mo files ,0

WINE-885,bug comments restored from gmane org when playing riven i can move ahead and the screens are fine but when i want to rotate the view the screen gets corrupted i think i have tracked the problem down to stretchblt and bitblt in x but i have run into problems debugging it it turns out that winedbg uses bitblt internalstretchblt extensivly so i cannot use winedbg to track down additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net created an attachment id screen shot before rotate additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net created an attachment id screen shot after rotate additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net created an attachment id screenshot of what it should look liek after rotate additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net created an attachment id short log file that goes with screen shots additional comments from dclark akamail com yep i agree i noticed that by setting transitions to best it becomes really obvious what is happening it is supposed to scroll the window left or right and then paints in the new portion of the display it does it with calls like this trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil which as you suggest causes a bitblt trace bitblt bitblt hdcsrc dc bpp hdcdest dc x x rop cc for some reason that does not seem to be working only the new part is being painted in the scroll never happens i never got much beyond that point additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net bitblt hdcsrc dc bpp hdcdest dc x x rop cc ok this looks to me like the source and destination are the same hdcsrc and hdcdest both dc based on my experience with simcity s screen corruption i am inclined to be suspicious of this the other thing about it is that it is bpp and as lionel says its evil source x source y destination x destination y width hieght so my assumption is that you clicked on the right side of the screen and the left hand side of the screen is not getting updated right additional comments from dclark akamail com yep that was a click on the right and of course there is a series of quick scrolls of various sizes corresponding to the various sized pieces left on the right side causing the screen corruption trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil trace scroll x drv scrolldc dc hrgnupdate rcupdate nil i think bits is only because that is what my video card is set for so that is what wine is using riven itself is only bit color as i recall additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net well i ve tracked it down to this code snippet case srccopy xcc if dcsrc bitsperpixel dcdst bitsperpixel wine tsx lock xsetfunction gdi display physdevdst gc gxcopy xcopyarea gdi display physdevsrc drawable physdevdst drawable physdevdst gc physdevsrc org x visrectsrc left physdevsrc org y visrectsrc top width height physdevdst org x visrectdst left physdevdst org y visrectdst top physdevdst exposures wine tsx unlock return true in each case it goes into this code xcopyarea is not a wine function can you confirm additional comments from dclark akamail com yep it looks like that for me i added a trace to check the parameters to xcopyarea and they look ok case srccopy xcc if dcsrc bitsperpixel dcdst bitsperpixel trace src xy d d size d d dst xy d d n physdevsrc org x visrectsrc left physdevsrc org y visrectsrc top width height physdevdst org x visrectdst left physdevdst org y visrectdst top i think what is happening is that the first bitblt is doing the scroll on an internal image trace bitblt bitblt hdcsrc dc bpp hdcdest dc x x rop cc trace bitblt bitblt internalstretchblt src xy size dst xy and then the second copies the entire image to the screen trace bitblt stretchblt dc x x x x rop cc trace bitmap x drv dib setimagebits xputimage x x b ec trace bitblt bitblt internalstretchblt src xy size dst xy the dst xy on this second one is offset to accomodate the frame i think additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net it s a timing problem it seems that when the source and destination are the same the screen is not updated properly before the next bitblt i found this out by putting a fixme in a for loop i wanted to slow this down so i could see the problem as it progressed what it did is clear the problem up physdevdst exposures wine tsx unlock if physdevdst physdevsrc int q for q q q fixme same source return true additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net created an attachment id horribly hacked solution that masks the problem patch additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net duane have you tried riven with either of my hacks and if so what do you think the problem is do you have any idea how to really fix this or should we leave it to one of the real wine guru s additional comments from dclark akamail com i tried both they partially fix it for me but not completely i still get a single piece of the old view though it is a much smaller piece than before it always happens if i first move forward and then turn sideways and of course the other noticable thing is that the window does not slide scroll but instead just jumps from one view to the other i notice that if i obscure part of the window with another window and then uncover it that it is repainted with the corruption still there by the way i can always get the window to repaint correctly by sliding my mouse down into the area at the bottom where the books are kept this might require the window focus to be set to focus follows mouse i don t really have much of a feel for where the problem is it appears to me that the bitblt commands have the correct parameters so like you i think this is some sort of timing problem i have the xlib reference book that explains the xcopyarea command but it does not mention any gotchas if the two drawables are the same at the point i don t think i now enough to know how to attack it additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net i ve had several days to think about this one and i have come up with the following conclusions the problem is not with the source and destination drawables being the same this is pretty rock stable stuff that has been tested in x for years also while debuging bug i noticed that when scrolling in the file dialog that the source and destination were the same with no screen corruption i had put a fixme in the code to detect this so it isn t this timing is a factor because slowing down the execution of same drawables clears up the problem somewhat if i move forward and then turn at the begining of the trace there is this fixme fixme bitblt x drv bitblt potential optimization client side dib copy this does not occure if i am turning around in circles what brought my attention to this is that another program that has screen corruption bug displays this fixme a lot all that means is that i understand the problem a little better and have a hint of where to look next i suppose my burning question at this point is what does the somewhat cryptic fixme really mean additional comments from dclark akamail com i think that slowing down redrawing is actually masking the problem rather than fixing it somewhat i noticed that what riven appears to do is measure how long it takes to perform a scroll and if it is too long riven does fewer scrolls with larger chunks i think this is what it is doing what it initially does several zero length scrolls and specifically what makes it appear to work is that if scrolling takes really long it does the scroll in a single step since the painting of the fill image has always worked if the fill image is the entire thing it appears to work so in short i am less confident now that it really is a timing issue additional comments from dclark akamail com fixed by http www winehq com hypermail wine cvs html additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net closing thanks duane ,0

WINE-14465,created attachment test project vs of a simple rpc client server to repro the problem rpc clients that specify variables or the return value as a comm status or fault status variable normally do not guard their rpc call with a seh try except clause after all using comm status or fault status variables is usually done because with these variables seh try except can be omitted as any exception from the client side or server side part of the call is transformed into an error value that is assigned to the comm or fault status variable however the current implementation of ndrclientcall unconditionally raises exceptions which an rpc client using comm status and fault status variables is not prepared or expected to handle as a result such rpc clients crash immediately if any error occurs during the course of an rpc call find attached a vs project of a simple rpc client and server that can call a variety of rpcs with different comm and fault status behaviour on client and server side that can be used to reproduce the problem start the server using rpcsrv exe portnumber start the client interactively and choose the rpc variant of choice ,1

WINE-TESTBOT-39425,currently the winetestbot gets stuck when the connection to the libvirt server on the vm hosts is broken this includes cases where the libvirt server is restarted the vm hosts is rebooted or cases where there s a network outage the reason is that the engine queries the status of the vms itself in some circumstances this creates a tcp connection which is never recreated in case it breaks the proper fix is to banish all such queries from the engine not just to fix this issue but also because some of these operation can be long a few seconds and block the main loop of the single threaded engine which can in turn cause the website to lag ,1

WINE-8143,installation for some reason i was inable to install igi from wine it displayed the initial progressbar and after filling it on and just before asking for a serial number the wine window closes without error warning or whatever so i installed under windows xp vmware and then transferred the codemasters directory tree to wine gameplay i ran several tests with different setup options in igi graphicssound and also several tests with different wine options windows xp the results were different the weird part is that they were different even with identical setups sequential runs once i even managed to get the game running i landed and started moving towards the fence but then i saw that all of the buildings were invisible just fences people and the land features oh and cameras hanging in the air but that was the only time i managed to get this far usually game breaks when the person jumps off the plane then the music changes and sound buffer underruns start to appear many messages like this one err dsound dsound mixone underrun on sound buffer x f sound is jerky and the picture hangs everytime i tried to skip the intro i got frozen screen showing the person already on the ground with crosshair visible and ready to play i clearly see there are improvements since last time i tried to run igi under wine back then the game would only start and allow me to see the initial screen and then immediately hangs ,1

WINE-421,when a program wants to perform a gdi operation on a dib most of the time the way we proceed is as follows convert the dib to a format that x understands invoke the corresponding x operation on the x bitmap convert the x bitmap back to dib format this is the case for drawarc lineto and even simple operations such as setpixel and getpixel this way of doing things saves us from having to implement quite a few functions that would each have to handle many bitmap formats but there are issues too the copies back and forth can be very costly optimizations are possible to avoid having to do the copies but they don t work in all situations the x bitmap has to be in the format of the x display so if x is running in bpp a bpp dib is converted to bpp the operation is performed in bpp and the bitmap is then converted back to bpp obviously this implies that each operation occurs a loss of color resolution fortunately they should not accumulate implementing a gdi renderer in wine would mean that all the above operations could be done directly on the dib this should provide better performance and also solve the color resolution issues some related emails from the wine dev archives re a new sdl back end we ve been toying with http www winehq com hypermail wine devel html starts http www winehq com hypermail wine devel html microwindows license http www winehq com hypermail wine devel html using microwindows nanogui http www winehq com hypermail wine devel html,1

WINE-17195,ok after a little bit of investigation i think i understand the pipes code enough to be able to say what s going on and i m seeing something like this process recvpipe createnamedpipe pipe fred readfile recvpipe buffer printf length readpipe recvpipe buffer no data process sendpipe createnamedpipe pipe fred length writefile sendpipe buffer length writefile sendpipe buffer what s happening is that the data being sent down the pipes isn t being done as datagrams the implementation is using a stream based fd the solution is you must implement a protocol on top of the pipes which sends the length as a bit int whatever which is read off the fd followed by the data stream of exactly that length must there s no two ways about this the protocol of pipes is unfortunately a combination of both datagrams and streams datagrams because the lengths of data sent are absolute and inviolate streams because the data order and reliability are also absolute and inviolate you can t use datagrams because they re unreliable you can t expect all unixen to support datagrams on top of unix sockets if that s what s being used so you have to send the length as part of the implementation of the pipe data send sending a length will also solve the issue of trying to send zero length pipe datagrams as a first implementation you might be able to get away with assuming that when someone asks for some data they will provide a buffer big enough actually i don t see any err more data error codes in ntreadfile so that would explain this is going to get messy ,1

WINE-1108,bug comments restored from gmane org this is best viewed in open dialogs when they are not in report mode often items in the rightmost column seems fully visible however clicking on such an item causes it to jump to the left of course the reason is that the listview code considers that the item was not fully visible and thus scrolls left by one column to make it fully visible however i think this can be confusing also this does not appear to be the behavior on windows although that may have changed in more recent comctl revisions making it even more confusing so i propose to select the item and not scroll left even if the item is not fully visible ,0

WINE-11607,hi there i m filing another blood bug this one is input related more precisely about keyboard input i know that the blood informations on the net mentioned the support for directinput devices but i m not sure this is a dinput bug so i m leaving this to unknown for now to the problem i installed blood through wine and did no patching version is still also the copy protection was not removed the executable should be clean starting the game and entering the configuration menu i noticed it was very hard to setup the keys i wanted to use in the game like moving forward backward etc when running blood natively you select a action in the menu you want to map you press enter and the game engine waits for you to press another key which it uses for mapping now when running wine i had to be really quick when pressing the mapkey like some milliseconds later it was really no fun to config the game when i wasn t quick enough for an action the enter key itself is mapped now the interesting part when not releasing the enter key after pressing it and then pressing the mapkey the process works i suspect that the enter key generates two events for the game pressing and releasing and the game interprets both events as seperate key presses so enter gots mapped to everything because the engine thinks it s pressed twice so either this is x related or a bug in the wine s keyb implementation thanks tobias,1

WINE-7359,sorry to flood with bugs but there are a bunch in the installer and i thought i d document them although i have a script that installs it just fine this is actually a rather strange error the installer tries to install ms components it needs e g mdac and then creates an msiexecuter lnk file in the startup area of the start menu so that the installer will restart when the user reboots of course wine currently ignores these files but this may not be true forever in any case the weird thing is that under wine both with wine msi and native msi the link references c rundll exe which of course does not exist i looked through the winedebug msi relay logs and it looks like the installer is looking in the wrong directory for rundll exe in the case of the wine msi it looks in c which is where the createprocess in dlls msi action c creates processes in native msi it creates the link in the current directory which is also incorrect and creates the wrong link however interestingly in windows it actually finds the right directory and links c windows system exe i will attach the two lnk files and the output of grep a b rundll log where log is the very large winedebug msi relay log of running wine setup exe misha p s since the path is not correct with both wine msi and native msi and is only correct on a native windows system i tested on on xp it does not need to install these components as they are already there so it is not testable so i am putting the bug in wine kernel as this is where file finding and such seems to be please correct if it is wrong ,0

WINE-822,the dib directdrawsurface blt function does not currently support ddblt keysrcoverride before i start i would like to say that i am aware that maxis came out with a linux version so please do not flame me the purpose of this bug report is to fix wine sim city is the only program i have that seems to use this but it uses it a lot it fills up any debug log with fixme s so i decided to do some investigation i wnt ont microsofts web site and i found this entry for ddblt keysrcoverride use the dcksrccolorkey member in the ddbltfx structure defined in the directdraw sdk documentation as the color key for the source surface if an override is not being set then dckdestcolorkey does not contain the color key the driver should test the surface itself what this sounded like to me was that if i made dib directdrawsurface blt ignore the ddblt keysrcoverride flag then the worst result would be that it used the wrong colors with this in mind i went into dlls ddraw dsurface dib c and changed it so it in fact ignored this flag the result was better then i expected at the beginning of the game there is a unique menu system that was invisible because nothing was being drawn when i made dib directdrawsurface blt ignore the flag the menu system showed up almost right at least it isn t invisible anymore this minor change improves how the whole game works in fact there are very few places that this does not make the game look better it seems that in this case at least the only thing it is used for is to mask out portions of the area that is being drawn ,0

WINE-1350, in an e mail from jukka heinonen but takecommand seems to show similar behaviour it looks like tc calls dos int routines for input output and expects that those interrupts somehow interact with tc window input related problem is quite easy to fix but i don t know how tc expects its window to be updated via int now you may check with the bit version too p yes i checked that it seems to have different bug than tc tc bug is definetely related to wine console handling code not wineconsole itself which seems to work quite differently under windows this is related to allocconsole conin conout handles and process initial handles nothing to do with winedos anyway ,1

WINE-22941,in rc under kde mandriva an incorrect behaviour of far manager is found this problem is new even rc has it not far manager is a win console norton like file manager wich can be used under wine using wineconsole like other two panel file managers far supports own hot keys which not always are the same as the standard hot keys in mswindows e g alt f is for far not a command for closing but for editing a file in native mswindows there are exist two ways to terminate far f key causes internal terminating of application with a prompt dialog auto saving of preferences etc clicking on the close button x on the top of the border of console window causes terminating of far immediately that can be useful to preserve default settings etc before the last wine release candidate the behaviour of wineconsole was the same as of the native mswindow console and i could quickly terminate far using kde made x button now clicking x standard close button on the right top of kde window containing wineconsole causes an emulation of a pressing of alt f at result the far manager does not terminate but opens a current file for edit that is a wrong behaviour wich can cause different problems for console applications with non standard hot keys maybe introducing a possibility to customize the handling of the standard wineconsole buttons could be also a good solution ,0

WINE-TESTBOT-31784,as we expand the number of configurations to test it seems wasteful to have to create and maintain a brand new vm just for them in a lot of cases all we need is to slightly reconfigure a vm to add a cd image add network interfaces or change the locale and run the test with these changes settings that s where snapshots can be useful take a snapshot for each configuration we need to test and then let the testbot start the vm from the right snapshot there is a catch though while it s possible to run the tests in two vms in parallel for a given vm only one snapshot can be active at a time there s two consequences testbot must know about snapshot and not try to simultaneously run the tests in two snapshots belonging to the same vm if in the base configurations those all wine patches run on we have a vm with ten snapshots it means we will need to run the tests ten times sequentially that vm is quickly going to become a bottleneck so we should still limit the number of snapshots per vm at least in the base configurations ,1

WINE-28422,created attachment patch to greatly reduce numerical noise in scanf conversion of doubles and long doubles if i compile the test scanf c code attached below using gcc test scanf c under mingw msys on wine i get the following results from running the a exe executable that is created by that build under wine bash exe echo e a exe e is input string e f b f f is long double value e b f f is double value e e b f a deaf e e b f a df b e e b f a df e e b f a df e e b f a df i annotate the above lines of output to demonstrate what the test application does read a string from stdin in this case e and output the result transform that string to a long double value bit floating point using sscanf with a format string of le and output that result in decimal and hexadecimal the decimal result in this case e immediately demonstrates the bad numerical significance loss in sscanf since the answer has a relative error of e rather than the expected relative error of order e the bit mantissa in the hexadecimal representation of the long double is shifted to the left on output by one bit to simulate the hidden bit that occurs for double values to make hex comparisons with the corresponding double in line easier transform the string to a double value bit floating point using sscanf with a format string of le and output the result in both decimal and unshifted hexadecimal form the decimal form of e demonstrates a relative error of e rather than the expected relative error of order of e use sprintf to write the double precision form of the number to a character string in rounded form using a precision of i where i ranges from to transform that string to a double value bit floating point using sscanf with a format string of le and output the rounded string the value of i and the double result in both decimal and unshifted hexadecimal form this test indicates how much precision is required for the conversion from double to a rounded string in order to read back a double that is the same as the original double in this case at a precision of and beyond sscanf provides consistent results but they are not the same as the original double because of the large numerical noise in the results from sscanf i then applied a patch attached to wine dlls msvcrt scanf h that fixes this numerical precision issue for conversions of doubles and long doubles by the scanf family of functions note wine dlls msvcrt scanf h and wine dlls msvcrt scanf h are identical so this patch should apply for wine as well what the patch does is make sure all calculations during the conversion are done in long double precision with results scaled in such a way that all calculations except a possible multiplication or division at the last are done with integers stored in long double form these changes assure exact results for input numbers between and that can be represented exactly in long double form and results with minimal numerical noise in other cases here are the same test results for this patched test case bash exe echo e a exe e is input string e f b f cb cefaf a is long double value e b f cb cefaf is double value e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf the results are vastly improved by the attached patch for the scanf family of functions now the relative numerical error for le conversion to long double is reduced from e to e and the relative numerical error for le conversion to double is reduced from e to e furthermore the round trip test of converting a double to rounded string form and then back to double shows exact agreement for other tests with repeating decimal input such as e exact agreement was obtained for a rounded precision of just as a matter of interest here are the results for the same test application compiled with gcc for linux on linux software raven echo e a out e is input string e f b f cb cefaf a is long double value e b f cb cefaf is double value e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf e e b f cb cefaf which is identical with the patched wine result except for the digit exponents when i created jpl binary ephemerides consisting of roughly gb of doubles from jpl ascii ephemerides with my ephcom software on linux and on wine built with the attached patch i got exact agreement between the double data for the linux and wine produced binary ephemerides in most cases however per cent of the time the double values on the two platforms differed at the e relative difference level which is consistent with scanf errors in the two cases differing on average by one in the last bit of the long double representation by chance such small differences would propagate to the double representation with bits less in the mantissa when counting the hidden bit roughly per cent of the time so i feel this patched scanf family of functions does very well against the linux equivalent i have classified this apparently long standing bug after a lot of thought as critical the reason for that classification is the scanf family is a fundamental building block for any platform and the numerical precision of the scanf family for double values is critical to a lot of applications such as ephcom where i first discovered the issue one could argue that a workaround is available dan kegel noted this on the wine devel list of using microsoft s version of msvcrt dll rather than the wine version so this is not critical because of the availability of that alternative msvcrt dll however there is a chicken egg problem here presumably some of those apps that use the microsoft version of msvcrt dll do so because the scanf numerical precision bug in wine s version is giving them trouble anyhow applying this patch going forward is fundamental to wine as an independent platform so that is why i chose to use a critical classification as a first approximation subject of course to any reclassification wine developers want to make for this bug

WINE-4200,basically to make this short could go into more detail but my knowledge of the wine loader code is just ok not really good i was attempting to run a less than perfect pe file seems to be a broken worm i was obviously prepared for it to not run perhaps the loader to error out since it was an invalid pe file at least xpsp believes so and i ve reversed other win loader code and they d error too but i got a segfault unfortunately i narrowed the issue down to dlls ntdll virtual c map image memset ptr sec virtualaddress file size end file size ptr is ok gdb p ptr x mz va for the section seems ok gdb p sec virtualaddress same with file size i believe but the issue is with the length of the memset gdb p end gdb p file size as you can see at virtual c memset uses end file size as the length to zero out however end file size creates a bad value since end is less than file size by at least c standards the length field for memset is a size t which is unsigned etc etc i don t really have a solution as i am not really all that knowledgeable with really what some of the code is doing but seems that atleast adding an assert or a test for this instead of blindly passing end file size would be a good thing anyway not a major bug but the loader should tries it s best to at least not crash if you need a test file please feel free to contact me at areiter at websense com ,0

WINE-8511,hi a friend of mine tried to run a win software i made which relies on drag and drop features my software is currently not working on wine we tracked the problem down to the dragqueryfilew function here is a reminder of the declaration uint dragqueryfilew hdrop hdrop uint ifile lpwstr lpszfile uint nbuffersize to get the needed length to store the file path i call this function with lpszfile set to null uint nneededlength dragqueryfilew hdrop ifile null nneededlength is the total number of characters not including the terminating null character as stated by the function documentation in msdn then i call the function again with a dynamically allocated buffer uint nret dragqueryfilew hdrop ifile pszfilepath nneededlength the is because dragqueryfilew expects a buffer size that counts the terminating null character the return value nret is equal to nneededlength on a real windows on wine instead we get the expected length i made a test i ran on windows then on wine that confirms the unexpected behavior by looking at wine source code it looks like the same problem exists with dragqueryfilea and dragqueryfile in shell c and shellole c a possible test case in a wm dropfiles handler wchar szsuperbuffer uint nfile uint nlengthneeded dragqueryfilew hdrop nfile null uint nret dragqueryfilew hdrop nfile szsuperbuffer sizeof szsuperbuffer uint nlengthgot strlenw szsuperbuffer if nlengthneeded nret nlengthneeded nlengthgot error message box error trace or whatever ,0

WINE-6415,i m testing a windows app i d very much like to run under wine being in touch with the author this is a small web server app called wrc for web remote center based on the microsoft mfc sample app httpsvr it happily works under windows but that d be the wrong thing for running it it s not yet working under wine fails to serve larger files but we ve pretty much narrowed down the problem by adding logs to the app and using ethereal for example the app tries to write a bytes jpg image to the socket but the socket only allows bytes at a time and the tcp stack fragments this in packets of bytes presumably because it only has buffers reserved so far so good we see them being sent on the ethernet and the ack s are coming in but after these packets there should be a signal to trigger the onsend function of the app so it can send the next part of data but this never happens the reselection of the socket did not return an error given the reselection is ok and at the ethernet level messages are consistently sent and ack s received the conclusion is that there might be a bug in wine so here we are stuck the error is very simple wrc server processes a request and builds a response in a memory buffer called m buf member of crequestsocket in case an image is requested it will realloc the buffer and read the complete image into the buffer setting m cbout to the number of bytes in m buf which are to be sent after this the asyncselect fd write fd close member of crequestsocket is called to initiate the writing of data to the network this in done by mfc windows calling the onsend member whenever the underlying socket is able to handle data in this function we send data and check for an error a partial send or a complete send every time a partial send is completed the asyncselect fd write fd close is repeated so mfc windows will get back to us when data is sent on the network and this seems to fail so have a look at the code in if nbytes m cbout this is what is being executed when we see that only of the bytes are sent ,0

WINE-20866,hello friends i appologize for disturbing you i hope i m not doing anything wrong by posting this thing here but i decided to try i ve been using debian for about a year and i ve got a bit of a problem with an electronic dictionary which is very dear to me since i work with texts it s the houaiss portuguese dictionary made for windows all the other dictionaries i use run perfectly well in wine but this one has got some kind of strange bug sometimes when i open it it appears as a minimized window at the panel below if you then click on it to maximize it instead of a full screen window what you get is only a very narrow strip of window if you click on its right hand upper corner in order do maximize it nothing happens all you can do is close it then if you run the programm again the same thing will happen no matter how many times you try if you uninstall the software and re install it completely usually the same thing happens a friend of mine wrote a script for me which has helped since with it i usually can make it work again but it s always a little bit annoying since it doesn t work immediately and you have to run the scrip a thousand times before the moody dictionary decides to work the scrip i ve been using to fix the problem runs as follows bin sh cp a wine working wine echo old good wine restored i m no expert al all as you can see so if you could help me and probably other portuguese speakers who use this dictionary to definetely solve this problem i d really appreciate i thank you very much for your attention and help zac,1

WINE-1406,bug comments restored from gmane org i have been hoping to see this working with baseline wine releases for about years now it s not a high priority but it s a curious problem one particular application i have errors out with a not enough space for environment message on startup i do not have the source code for this application the application itself is a bit vb application used to access an online database the header indicates it s an mz type executable and the imports show it s based on vbrun there s an ne marker in the header as well another application with exactly the same header but a different app nonetheless works just fine the wine trace shows the following as the cause err local local getblock not enough space in local heap dc for bytes now all that said if i uncomment the fixmes int memory local c and prevent the call from returning in local getblock it works fine for a while at least so i guess the question is why are the fixme s in that function still fixme s after all this time i m sure there is a reason for not uncommenting this code but if anybody could shed light on this or get the fixme s accepted it would be really appreciated additional comments from marc lavergne yahoo com i did some more digging it appears that the local heap is hitting the k barrier on an attempt to grow it the application actually fails in growheap around line where the check to see if oldheap xfff eval to true and a false gets returned the error just bubbles up from the call to growheap in getblock all the heap pointers and size values seem normal so it s really running out of space fair enough so the question becomes why is the heap not being exceeded in native win but is being exceeded in wine it only makes sense that some cleanup of the heap happens under native win that is not happening under wine i m a little at a loss from that point though i assume a heap walker like program would be helpful additional comments from bon elektron ikp physik tu darmstadt de probably we put things on the local heap that don t belong there try to find out what items there take up the most space additional comments from marc lavergne yahoo com makes sense can you recommend a program that will let me see calls to the local heap under win x and i will try to track it down the error occurs early during startup so accounting for the allocations by hand is a possibility i ll compare it to the calls i see under wine and post back on another note there s a an application that starts with the problem vb program auto magically under win wsasrv exe windows sockets asynchronous request server it appears it is being launched by one of the vbxs this program does not start with the working vb bit prog also i took a look at the heap using heapwalk exe but it didn t show anything of value besides a rough count of m for the total heap size when running under win additional comments from marc lavergne yahoo com since there s a workaround moving this to a normal severity i haven t had a chance to revisit it but i will get the heap alloc trace done shortly workaround modify local getblock in memory local c to prevent arena exits not a permanent fix since it introduces an unhandled condition and is the wrong way to do things anyhow ,1

WINE-8236,there are a couple different effects of this bug first there is the part where if you kill an enemy it doesn t fall over and die like it normally should instead it will remain standing or even in some cases walking or attacking the attack animation it doesn t actually do a damaging attack second there is an issue with ranged attacks melee attacks do not appear to be effected by this ranged attacks animate much much faster than they should in the case of some spells there s no animation at all where there should be a particle effect as a result of this the npcs are able to attack considerably faster than they should at the same damage this makes some enemies with ranged attacks obscenely powerful in the case of the spells that don t animate at all getting within range of them pretty much means you re just going to be watching your health bar steadily drop note that this should only effect single player with multiplayer the attack speeds should be governed by the host not the local animations ,1

comments from juan virtual orbis com created an attachment id miranda showing icons in submenus under w additional comments from juan virtual orbis com created an attachment id same submenus under wine additional comments from mike theoretic com ok i think that s probably a separate bug you might want to open a miranda icq tracking bug then make them all depend on that one additional comments from juan virtual orbis com under display of m icon is partially fixed when a child window is spawn this child window displays perfectly perfect colorfull drawn icon buttons in child window but when this child window is closed m returns to the initial state corrupt m icon again that s weird additional comments from mike theoretic com hmmm we had a patch lately to fix imagelist corruption i d forgotten about this bug so it should have been fixed the fact that it isn t concerns me slightly i ll try and remember to take a look at miranda again when i get back to my flat poke me in a week if i ve forgotten ie haven t posted to this bug additional comments from juan virtual orbis com under when child window is active miranda main window is redrawn well m gets partially fixed weird cannot capture a snapshot of this redrawn main window with ksnapshot captured picture shows no changes at all when this child window goes off it is not current window miranda main window gets back with the corrupt m icon whether it is the active window or not moreover miranda s normal behaviour under win when child window is spawn is that miranda main window grays out the m icon color in m icon gets replaced with shades of gray see my snapshot additional comments from juan virtual orbis com created an attachment id when child window is spawn main window redraws failed to capture this additional comments from juan virtual orbis com created an attachment id miranda child window under win additional comments from mike theoretic com confirmed it s still there ,1
WINE-11559,created attachment blood version in d d mode hi there this is partially referring to my other bugreport about blood the chosen but this time i didn t update to version number but left the game unpatched with no copy protection fix applied the game has version number and crashes when running the engine in d d mode software rendering works and also results in a smoother input in the menu but graphics are really ugly so anyway i can manage to start the game in d d mode and the intros etc play but this is really slow and the client exe main engine executable consumes cpu time i can get to the menu of the game but after selecting campaign and difficulty level the screen stops updating and i have a crashreport on the console where i started wine from going to attach the logs i have made one log when trying the game with d d mode and two logs in software mode both low quality and high quality not much console output difference there greets tobias,0

WINE-1129,bug comments restored from gmane org there is this freeware game called dink smallwood which i would like to play and it almost works but not quite you walk around in this game in a view from above like in the old zeldas or ultimas but wine does not draw the floor tiles which is quite annoying the link to the game is http www rtsoft com dink download htm there are two function calls which i believe to have identified as the culprits dib directdraw blt or dib directdraw bltfast the first function call complains saying that dblt async dblt wait is not supported but as far as i understand the source code still everything should be rendered the second function is also called a lot and here i am not so sure what happens is this function completely implemented i think it is strange that the last argument is zero whenever the game calls it i read the specification on the ms homepage and it does not say that you can call it with a zero parameter additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net you can discount the warning about async wait as this does not apply to the way wine deals with ddraw the other function bltfast might be the culprit but you did not include the exact fixme error message i will try to get a look at this program if time permits i have also cc d lionel who is the real ddraw expert additional comments from lionel ulmer free fr out of curiosity with which wine version was that tested with latest cvs i do not have anything displayed at all just a white square on the screen additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net i installed it with a very recent version of cvs a couple of days ago i have a wine with windows setup maybe thats the difference i have a problem with the mouse at the startup screen i cannot see it by guess and a liitle luck i was able to get a game started i get a rd person view of dink and have no problem moving around with the keyboard the floor ground tiles are white just like reported i have not had much of a chance to play debug it additional comments from kniederk math uni koeln de sorry when i posted the bug report i forgot to tell this i also get the white screen at the beginning but after some time maybe pressing the mousebuttons or something i reach the start menu where the mouse pointer does not work continuing here requires a bit of patience moving the mouse around until a sign appears at the menu entry this depends a lot on luck sometimes i m able to do this within seconds sometimes it takes me more than or minutes anyway it is possible to start the game just a bit difficult to the question what the exact error message is there is no error message apart from the async stuff i ran with wine debugmsg relay and looked through the messages displayed and i thought that dib directdraw bltfast might be the problem but i have no clue at all thanks for your work on this klaus additional comments from lionel ulmer free fr as i still have no luck managing to get the game to run i have crashes due to winmm and sound stuff could you attach to this bug report a ddraw trace wine debugmsg ddraw additional comments from kniederk math uni koeln de i never had a crash i think i first tried the game month ago i m using kde i e artsd otherwise i don t know i found out a way to start the game more reliably press at the menu screen alt d to enter debug mode now move the invisible cursor with the cursor keys to the coordinates x y the mark should appear next to the start entry press ctrl to start the game lionel i produced the trace you requested but it is over mb in

comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net please attach trace next time additional comments from kniederk math uni koeln de sorry for the trace inside the comment i took a look myself at the wine code and while i did not solve the real bugi found a smaller one in the debugging output which i have fixed i m veryproud of myself as you maybe see in the trace but probably not the last argument of thesurface bltfast fnc is and latter in the debugging output you see trans but the value of trans which is given by the last argument is not displayed the reason is the following include ddraw h trans ddbltfast nocolorkey but in dll ddraw helper c the debugging output is generated by ddraw dump flags for i i num names i if names i val flags dprintf s names i name the if does not detect the case trans so i modified this into for i i num names i if names i val flags dprintf s names i name else if names i val flags dprintf s names i name i don t know if this is the fix like it should be or not but i m proud anyway i still have no clue why the game does not work cheers klaus additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net allright what the heck are you doing the messes up your comments are you pasting them in is it your browser as it is the comments are not very usefull additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de yep that sounds like it s definitely a bug albeit a relatively minor one i d propose something like static void ddraw dump flags dword flags const flag info names size t num names int newline unsigned int i for i i num names i if flags names i val

lclose handle additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de vfat ioctl readdir both doesn t matter since it s on a non vfat partition and we just probe for vfat properties apart from that no idea additional comments from kniederk math uni koeln de today i m using ie so i hope this helps with the formatting could someone tell me if the tile bitmaps are loaded or is there some way to find this out i guess that wine does not have problems with capital letters and such in filenames since windows does not distiguish them as far as i know anyway in case this is not the error i have been doing some reverse engineering in dink smallwood maybe someone can give me a hint on what to test next basically dink smallwood uses a display surface with a front and backbuffer x an offscreen memory surface of the same size and some smaller surfaces containing objects when the player enters a new room the offscreen memory surface is painted with the ground tiles and this remains fixed until the player enters another room every time a frame is drawn the offscreen surface is copied first to the backbuffer to paint the floor and then the other several objects trees people etc are copied directly to the backbuffer when this is finished the back and frontbuffers are switched and the steps above repeat what i am wondering is why the objects are visible but the floor tiles are not the only differences i see for now is that the objects are copied directly to the backbuffer while the floor tiles are copied first to the offscreen memory and then to the backbuffer and the second difference is that the floor tiles are stored in regular bmp files while the objects are stored in some format which i do not recognize what could i test next thanks klaus additional comments from kniederk math uni koeln de i m sorry about this fuzz with the strace where i didn t see the loading of the bitmaps the problem was that these files are opened by another win thread and this was not monitored by strace to get it right you need to use strace f wine dink exe what should i try next klaus ,1

WINE-13612,the entire season and probably of sam and max titles from telltale games suffers from odd graphics glitches the games otherwise work fine but the animated characters are incorrectly drawn many are either completely or partially invisible some like the main protagonists sam and max have some segments of theirs stretched out and pointing into the distance this message may be of relevance it gets flooded on the terminal launched from fixme d d draw drawstridedfast gl invalid operation x from gldrawelements drawprim c the issue is discussed on the appdb pages some appear to be having these games running flawlessly and i suspect this is an issue limited to nvidia cards and drivers i m running the proprietary nvidia driver version on a centos distribution with a geforce ti graphics card i ve tried almost every wine version from or so to rc and the problem has been present throughout for testing this bug it may be interesting that the full episode abe lincoln must die is available for free at the telltale games website wine should probably be set to windows vista to run it ,1
WINE-2593,the wm mousewheel message is specified to have absolute screen coordinates unlike the wm lbuttondown etc messages which are client coordinate system x drv mouse c and windows input c treat them all identically client so wm mousewheel messages are delivered to the correct window and appear to work but have the wrong coordinates so programs that use the coordinates to redistibute the mousewheel message ie to override the focus wind up delivering the mousewheel messages to grossly incorrect windows so much so that the mouse scroll is unusable the syntheyes program at www ssontech com shows this clearly you can find multiple images of the overall screen wide scroll wheel mapping within each subwindow because the mousewheel coordinates are being sent in client coordinates not screen coordinates this problem should be fixable with a slight modification to mouse c get coords to allow the client rectangle mapping to be turned off for wm mousewheel i m not entirely sure what the story is with the two mappings in the routine without running a debugger on it or i d propose a patch sorry no experience to be able to do this for future note i think the mapping to client coordinates for the lbuttondown etc messages should actually be in windows input c queue mouse event with no mapping in get coords the hardware message between the two is intended to always pass screen coordinates in screen normalized coordinates not to be normalizing the client coordinate values as is currently done but that s a fine point for now the key point is to fix this bug so syntheyes can be run under linux tnx ,0

WINE-229,it chokes on the following line long double atold const char the reason it does not compile is that wrc does not consider this to be a function declaration to wrc a function declaration has identifiers followed by an opening parenthesis here even after the preprocessing we have three in fact we may have even more the well known extern const unsigned long int foo immediately comes to mind i checked how rc from vc handles this and made the following observations you cannot put even a basic int foo in the rc file you can put any garbage you want in any of the included files the only things that rc checks for in included files are comments and strings sort of there s something fishy happening if you put a at the end of the line preprocessor directives i e lines starting with a no it does not care about balanced parenthesis braces semi colons or anything of the sort on the other hand wrc tries very hard to preprocess everything correctly so i believe the best way to fix this problem is to modify wrc to behave just like rc does ,1

WINE-926,bug comments restored from gmane org upon last attempt at running diablo ii with regular wine i e not winex diablo ii doesn t even start more than likely it is due to the lack of some directx components unfortunately with work taking most of my time and my computer being in the shop right now i am unable to test with the latest cvs or snapshot releases but i will post an update asap dustin additional comments from uh ja gmx net actually wine missing is not missing directx components for d d does work in wine just fine for me what is not supported in wine which will block d from running would be securom so find a nocd patch for d to try it under wine additional comments from speeddymon yahoo com hmm i didn t think of that i will try it asap and append the results additional comments from speeddymon yahoo com havent been able to try it just yet but i will append the results when i get a chance for now resolving as worksforme additional comments from gsstark mit edu i used to play diablo ii regularly under wine however after a long hiatus i tried again recently and it didn t work it just sat there no errors no windows nothing happened it seems either newer versions of wine have a regression here or there s an incompatibility with x or linux or something else on my system that s been updated i straced the process and it just sat calling wait but then i guess that s normal it s hard to trace a program that forks so much additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net could you do some regression testing on this to find out what patch broke it http www winehq org

from what i can tell dont have original cd right now it is at a friend s dload exe and game crk exe bnet loader and patched game exe game crk exe works for single player only dload exe is the file causing the errors if you need to run the game on bnet with the loader for whatever reason email me by clicking on my name above this post i will email you a script to get it working it does the same thing as dload exe but it is in script form so that you can do it on linux additional comments from speeddymon yahoo com i guess that this issue is technically resolved not a bug but a problem on my end i will file a new bug tonight when i get off work for the dload exe loading problem though greg please try to run d on the latest cvs of wine if the issue still exists please file a new bug and be sure to include some debug output d d should work additional comments from speeddymon yahoo com i guess that this issue is technically resolved not a bug but a problem on my end i will file a new bug

WINE-839,a program called warcraft iii video test allows for testing opengl d d when running the opengl test under wine it creates a window for an opengl rendering but at the same time it minimizes making the original window active the test therefore turns out wrong although it will go through like it is working you can get the program here http ftp blizzard com pub war other videotest zip a similar problem occurs in the game warcraft iii beta when you don t have a sound driver loaded it creates an opengl window but after that it displays a messagebox saying it couldn t initialize the sound driver because of that the game minimizes you close the messagebox and you can still type into the game esc to exit loading a sound module prevents this problem i tried a rudimentary fix by disabling the minmaximize function found where ever it is winpos c i think warcraft iii the game will load normally because you close the messagebox to continue but the videotest enters an endless or very long loop because it keeps switching the active state between the opengl window and the main window probably the reason they keep the main window active is in case the video test fails the program can still recover from a fullscreen mode you can try to restore the opengl window but it doesn t restore properly that is probably a different problem though i m just concerned that it shouldn t minimize the window in the first place in normal windows os it doesn t minimize these windows ,1

WINE-22978,created attachment mci winmm trace crash backtrace the attached log shows a crash that is triggered because the asynchronous mciseq mcimidi player is still attempting to open the device while the main thread already successfully called mci close the mcimidi player does not implement proper locking unlike mciwave its state variable is not yet set to mci mode play when opening the midi device which lets mci close not see something is busy playing actually even looking at mciwave one can construct unfortunate sequences of scheduling that would cause mciwave to hang in such a situation so there s no trivial patch simply moving wmm dwstatus mci mode play a couple of lines up the crash generally occurs when starting simcity using wine c program game simcity exe curiously wine start simcity exe always works as i said it s a race condition it seems like sometimes the initialisation of winmm and midi takes a long time the bug is then triggered when mci close is called by the application mci close is called among others when clicking exit in the initial menu often enough the app crashes before showing this menu imho the fact that the app calls mci close that early is triggered by another bug in wine that appdb testers have mentioned every now and often but never put to bugzilla simcity starts fine showing its logo when using full screen mode but needs a resize or uniconify when using a virtual desktop then presumably the app sends mci close to stop the music causing or not a crash via the present race condition btw since the crash occurs in the asynchronous mci midi player the app nevertheless works this issue has nothing to do with the bug presumably in the app that wine simcity exe crashes whereas wine c full path simcity exe should work ,1

WINE-18758,lsagetlogonsessiondata unconditionally returns status success applications that use lsagetlogonsessiondata normally rely on a different behaviour if lsagetlogonsessiondata returns status success it allocates a buffer for the caller now if a client app relies on a buffer being allocated and reads from this buffer it will surely crash therefore lsagetlogonsessiondata should return an error code such as status not implemented as long as it is only a stub so client apps that do proper error handling do not get tempted to touch the buffer that the current implementation in wine will not allocate for them ,0

WINE-35626,created attachment backtrace of the exception wine trace log and an example c of the bug the game patrician iii rise of the hanse crashes by a divide by zero exception in certain conditions later explained i ve debugged and found the root of the bug it s a side effect in the wine implementation of user subtractrect function in my attachment there s a c program that simulates the error and a fixed version of the function to avoid it i m using wine but this bug applies to all versions of wine to this day in git master it s here https github com mirrors wine blob master dlls user uitools c l the bug was already reported serveral times but due to lack of new information it was closed abandoned for example bugs and the bug is also mentioned as well known in the comments of the appdb entry of patrician iii the vast majority of users avoid the bug disabling the feature that triggers it other applications can be also affected by this bug see later but first is first the symptoms the users of patrician suffer this bug when they try to scroll the city view and that city has a layer of weather effects rain fog snow if the user changes the view of the city using the minimap it works but only if the original rectangle of the view and the rectangle of the new position don t overlap if they overlap in any way or when the user tries to scroll the view then it always overlap the situation is detected by a call to user intersectrect function that returns true and the program branchs through calls to subtractrect i suppose to find the area that it s not in common between the two views these calls fail when the actual version of the wine user library is used they return an empty rectangle with values instead the expected one the code of patrician iii is not prepared to handle the unexpected result and when it tries to use such values in some calculations including a division it crashes due a divide by zero exception that s what i found debugging the executable with winedbg the attachment includes a log of part of the calls it s a long list but the only relevant info is just before the exception near the end of the file the cause of this bug lies in let s say an unorthodox use of the subtractrect function in the common case the wine version works flawlessly but that particular code of patrician iii calls subtractrect using the same pointer for the out value dst and one of the in values src one of the first things that the wine implementation of subtractrect does is copying the scr value to dst but with dst src the assign also changes src as a side effect provoking the bug that behaviour is what is needed to fix this bug can also affect other programs that uses the function in the same way fortunately the bug is not present in windows version so there can t be any program that rely on it in my attachment the subtractrect c that can be compiled alone to demo the bug behaviour it calls subtractrect a straight version from source code with different parameters working as intended and with the st and rd same parameter bug the c has defines in the beginning one to show more debug info and another to replace subtractrect with a fixed subtractrect that i tested the fix is not probably the best of the solutions it only delays the copy dest src past the uses of src and src but it works a better solution probably wouldn t use dst as a lvalue at all only as a rvalue i ve applied the patch to wine and now patrician iii is working with the weather effects to high ,0

WINE-906,bug comments restored from gmane org wine version obtained a couple of nights ago from ximian i had to rebuild my system from a hd failure last week latest wine version doesn t seem to work with quicken deluxe program installs ok i can open up my restored data files i open the register and begin to enter a new entry i enter the date press tab enter the check number and press tab quicken freezes up i can quit the program by going back to the shell i launched wine from and pressing control c i also note that cpu utilization jumps when this happens from to more than using top to monitor also i notice that if i use the mouse and not the tab key i can get by that point and continue entering data when i get to entering the check amount quicken tells me to enter a number in nnn nn format well i did furthermore even opening the little quicken calculator doesn t work no numeric entry in a currency field is understood additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de please try with a current wine version the number field sounds like it may be oleaut related we ve had quite a few oleaut fixes in between thanks additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net jeff part of the problem that the developers with of wine face is that we need bug reports for programs that we do not have access to so bug reports for any program are nesessary and appreciated however at this point the ximian release of wine is releases behind winehq releases a new version of wine usually about once a month development in wine is very active and this bug might be fixed in a more current release for that reason it is recomended that you install from tarball or better yet cvs building wine from source is harder to do than installing from ximian i know that for sure since i use ximian its one sweet package manager that being said though the amount of extra effort is not imo that much if ugrading your wine does not fix the problem a trace wine debugmsg dialog would be usefull additional comments from jeffmay earthlink net thanks for the additional comments tonight when i get home i shall give a later version a try i wonder if it s related to recent kernels i found these in the wine users lists http www winehq com hypermail wine users html he s got one of the same symptoms i ve seen i am using quicken more than five years with most of the features working at least usable now since i upgrade suse can not use quickenw because not let me type in numbers always get error please type in number in nnnn nn format certainly i did but error message come back again again another one http www winehq com hypermail wine users html additional comments from tony lambregts telusplanet net thankyou for the additional information if you still see this with the latest release of wine at least we have a couple of places to look at i think that this one is the most interesting this is from steve varadi first post fixme shdocvw wboc getcontrolinfo stub lpcontrolinfo x df if i recall correctly shdocvw defaulted to native builtin and only recently within the last couple of months changed to the following shdocvw builtin native this looks like a regression as well in his next poststeve varadi wrote the following this way quickenw is unusable i never experiented this kind of problem with quicken it was working more than five years for me under wine could anyone give some hints what went wrong so i think that using a native shdocvw dll might solve your problem but it won t fix wine additional comments from jeffmay earthlink net additional information i was asked to replace the builtin shdocvw dll with a native version which i did no change in behavior i then ran wine debugmsg dialog qw exe from the quicken program directory here is a copy of the generated log

disappears as does the splash screen the whole screen is now locked apart from the kde panel with the cursor showing the hourglass when menus are lauched from the panel the mouse works properly in menu menu is draw correctly but when leave menu nothing is re drawn sometimes especially if left in locked state photoshop will use all available memory real swap and linux will hang repeatability

whole screen apart from the kde panel i am happy to provide debug reports but i ll need guidance as to how to proceed because all debug logs i ve created are large and photoshop must run at a reasonable rate so i can kill it before something to do with shfolder dll seems to occur near wher dll is loaded additional comments from ownq k sneakemail com in the bug report i didn t complete this paragraph i am happy to provide debug reports but i ll need guidance as to how to proceed because all debug logs i ve created are large and photoshop must run at a reasonable rate so i can kill it before it consumes all memory additional comments from ownq k sneakemail com looking closely the window manager controlled parts of the window disappear too this suggests some foulup relating to x communication as the area is obviously grabbed but there s not title bar to minimise the grabbed window with additional comments from ownq k sneakemail com it turns out that photoshop removes all top level windows from the kde panel additional comments from ownq k sneakemail com did some serious gdb debugging on the problem conclusion this is an x driver problem moving to x driver component motes on the debug session follows the problem occurs as st wine processs exits with error code after this the wineserver process and possibly another wine process seem to go mad they cause kernel load and

window additional comments from ownq k sneakemail com more info on the setparentcall failure the call to setparent is setparent hwnd broadcasta window so it looks as if it attempts to broadcast this to all top level windows don t know what windows does but i m certain it shouldn t fail as badly as it does my suggestion handle the bad match error and return an error result to the calling app if possible to fix this properly need a test for the behaviour on windows on the hang i suspect that wine shouldn t in theory hang on an error like this i suspect it does hang because because it s attempting to open the debugger while some of it s windows are mangled will test disabling the bebugger in wine config ,0

WINE-4332,hallo the paragraph that describes installing wine from source should be more verbose for example during bug reporting process i have been told that in order to enable cups support in compiled wine the libcupsys dev package should be installed in system there is no mention in documentation about such needs and configure has complained only about missing x dev libraries that i have resolved quickly i think printing is such a notorious thing when you use computer so that any steps necessarry to gain this kind of functionality should be mentioned in the guide i have no deeper knowledge what are the other such dependencies for example i don t know whether it is necessarry to install some packages to get sound working in compiled wine etc so please if there are some dependencies like the libcupsys dev one can somebody competent create a neat table and insert it to the user s guide chapter discussing the compilation ,1

WINE-10521,the msvcrt heap test has been consistently crashing on my computer since the following commit commit a e f dbef d f e d aabe author dan kegel date tue nov it crashes with winedebug access to x and winedebug warn heap access to x and an assertion aborts the program with winedebug heap it crashes when compiling gcc from debian stable the whole wine dlls programs and executables with o o and o so that is probably not due to a compiler optimization screwup i ve been discussing the issue for a while with dan and he is able to reproduce the problem however all commit a e f does is fixing two memory leaks therefore neither of us feels that the change in this commit should cause a crash there may be a problem somewhere else since it touches the heap subsystem i m putting severity to major while commenting tests in order to reduce the testcase by looking at the traces i found that a crash can be triggered but not reproducably with the single test aligned realloc everything before and after this line being commented strange attached is a tarball i sent to dan which contains a script to run the test in various situations compilation is not part of the script if you want to run valgrind you have to edit the location of valgrind to match the location of wine improved valgrind http wiki winehq org wine and valgrind traces created by the script i noticed that a invalid arena magic warning is triggered by warn heap before the crash occurs so i made a trivial patch that adds printing of the invalid arena magic values i think it helps debugging the issue by showing the exact kind of overwrite that occurred byte byte byte which bytes of the arena are affected etc with warn heap crash the arena magic is x with heap assert failed the arena magic is x ,0

WINE-26417,when playing starcraft mouse capture seems to be broken in both windowed and fullscreen mode mouse capture is important in sc because moving the mouse to the border scrolls the screen this seems to stem from two separate problems windowed mode since sc gives you more relative viewing area when running in widescreen mode i tried running in a widescreen window in my fullscreen monitor however i can t get the mouse to stay inside the screen while playing either with the default mouse capture setting or setting wine to emulate a virtual desktop and using fullscreen mode in sc fullscreen mode when using dual head mode twinview on nvidia and playing sc at the native resolution of one of my monitors the mouse doesn t stay on that monitor it still jumps over to the other monitor whichever side it s attached to this is annoying but not as bad as the first case since the mouse is captured on sides the mouse works fine when running in one monitor in fullscreen mode which is the only way to play at the moment to reproduce run sc in windowed mode or in fullscreen mode with emulate virtual desktop or fullscreen mode with multiple monitors might be problem with the directinput emulation but i specified unknown since i m not sure ,1

WINE-6677,numeric formats used with a large specified precision or very large floats will cause buffer overflows in msvcrt printf there are safeguards of sorts in pf vsnprintf but they only check the field width which is not even relevant for one of the two cases as the bit integer code uses the safe pf fill function to expand the number checking flags precision here instead of flags fieldwidth when deciding whether to dynamically allocate memory for the representation of the number before padding and changing the behaviour of pf integer conv which is also unsafe would eliminate this buffer overflow the other case is more complicated as a formatting string is reconstructed and sent to the system sprintf the character buffer allocated unless a larger minimum field width is specified can easily be overrun with large floating point value converted with the f specifier for example or again any value if the precision given is large more advanced calculations or use of snprintf is required additionally when extra memory is allocated pf vsnprintf uses the pointer to the static buffer instead of the dynamically allocated one in the heapfree call ,0

WINE-41437,two weeks ago i saw commit e f bc e c a ebf e f f aa edd that partially implements std type info hash function code was simple but the bit version was not implemented as it was using different constants i thought findind a coefficient only requires time and patience let s do it i had to find a value noted as here that is such that xcbf ce fd bfc x xaf bc c a or xcbf ce fd bfc xaf bc c a i started with a naive implementation computing all values from to uint max was very long and very slow i optimized it using openmp pragma omp parallel causing all my cpus to work at still very slow and the topmost bit would be tested in ages i then had the idea to use a pseudo random non repeating number generator this way all numbers would be tested in pseudo random order and equally distributed on the bit range plus with the known seed and index it would be posible to stop and continue the computation at the point it stopped i chose blowfish algorithm and let it work for about a week and then realized i may need a better solution finding the bit value was very quick less than a minute but a bit value is way larger and testing every bit takes a really long time normally if i have something like i can do here we abuse overflow so mathematically it s more xcbf ce fd bfc mod xaf bc c a i discovered we can actually do modular multiplicative inverse to find an inverse of a number such as a mod x a mod x b mod x b i found a c implementation that finds the inverse of a number modulo another i started with the bit version to test it no mod to make it concise x c dc x x c b c x c dc x c b c x modinverse x c dc x no inverse because x c dc is even anyway let s do it with x x c dc x x c x c dc x c x c dc inverse is xdce f in other words x c dc xdce f mod x so x c xdce f x we can verify that x c dc x x c and that x c dc x x c b c we have our bit coefficient note that x requires bits so it s ok on my bit computer but as you may have guessed x is bits i tried using uint t but didn t work i then used gmp library the gnu multiple precision arithmetic library which lets me work on numbers as big as i have memory let s do it again for the bit version mox omitted xcbf ce fd bfc x xaf bc c a xcbf ce fd bfc xaf bc c a xcbf ce fd bfc has no inverse because xcbf ce fd bfc is even xcbf ce fd bfc x xaf bf c xcbf ce fd bfc xaf bf c xcbf ce fd bfc inverse is xdbab bd a eb in other words xcbf ce fd bfc xdbab bd a eb mod x so xaf bf c xdbab bd a eb xa b ca c we can verify that xcbf ce fd bfc xa b ca c xaf bf c but xcbf ce fd bfc xa b ca c xaf bc c a i tested with x x x inverse is ok but was always different and wasn t working i was missing something i googled x and found out that it s a well known number used in fnv and fnv a hash algorithms https en wikipedia org wiki fowler e noll e vo hash function ideal bit called fnv prime is xcbf ce which slightly differs from our xcbf ce fd bfc since only the low word is changed i guessed it was a xor operation on the low part i tested xcbf ce i xcbf ce fd bfc in a loop and found i was xcbf ce i retested with other values et voil i found how it worked i just submitted a patch to fix this bug i posted a detailed explanation here to prove i didn t disassembled the native dll and maybe to tell people it s not that hard to do useful things in wine by the way it s a fun way to learn things ,0

WINE-1372,bug comments restored from gmane org why is it not advisable to run wineinstall as root when it asks for the password later anyway why does wineinstall further assume the current user has write access to the wine source root i don t see why i must chown my entire source as a regular user then su to that user then install and be asked for the root password so that wineinstall can install correctly i keep my sources in usr src and they are owned by root perhaps wine should let me install as root if i wish to do so why does wineinstall not allow the installation of a global windows root why can t it su to root and create one or allow users to run it as root why am i told to run wineinstall as root to generate a global wine conf if i refuse to make a local one when wineinstall refuses to be ran as root finally why can t wineinstall be incorporated in make install additional comments from andi rhlx fht esslingen de a because users use root way too often it s a counter measure b because wineinstall configures the wine environment for a specific user a wine configuration is not global thus you need start with this specific user and when it wants to install the wine files on your system you are supposed to provide the root password why am i told to run wineinstall as root to generate a global wine conf if i refuse to make a local one when wineinstall refuses to be ran as root hmm if it still says that then it s a bug a global wine conf is deprecated yep it s a bug finally why can t wineinstall be incorporated in make install because make install shouldn t do what wineinstall does and the other way around make install simply installs the compiled wine files on the system whereas wineinstall is a one size fits all for lazy users which configures everything down to the kitchen sink confirming since wineinstall still talks about wine conf,1

WINE-959,bug comments restored from gmane org the choosefont dialog when not using unicode has an option to select which script will be used when the font supports more than one this option is not implemented in wine at the moment in principle it shouldn t be too dificult to implement all that needs to be done is adding a combo box to the dialog layout and filling it out with the result of getfontunicoderanges there is only really need to check for those ranges that correspond to the defined charsets symbol charset shiftjis charset etc there is however some need to tweak the resources for each of these charset you probably need the demo text to use locale independant the display name to use i e shiftjis charset is japanese if the current locale is english russian charset is russian if the current locale is english etc it is my experience that under windows choosefontw puts this combo box in but disables it ugly additional comments from winebugzilla sun consumer org il the code for is commited the code for is coming soon in addition there is the entire business of managing the charsets in unicode and ansi mess ,1
