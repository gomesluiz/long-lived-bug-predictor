QVTO-210916,currently the codesense response is slow on large qvto scripts in complex cases of nested constructions the correct proposals are not given this is because codesence is based on the compilation of the entire script with its dependencies thus when the script is large or imports other scripts the compilation performance is poor the backtracking parser attempts to apply error based rules in case of incomplete scripts which is the general case while writing a script and tries to minimize the amount of errors such behaviour is wrong in case of code completion remedy improve the performance and accuracy by applying a lexer based approach which would select only those parts of script that are needed for codesense proposing and then compiling only lightweight passages of qvt code ,0

ORBIT-266232,as described in bug we would like to generate p repositories as part of the orbit build process this bug was opened to promote discussion on whether or not the format of our build results should change currently when we complete an orbit build we produce the following a zip file of all bundles in orbit a bundles directory with all of the orbit bundles in it jar based bundles use the jar file extension and directory based bundles like source bundles use zip as the file extension also included in the build result are map files psf files iplogs etc but we will ignore those for the purposes of this discussion so a couple of questions do we still need the zip of all the orbit bundles orbit has gotten quite big and now there are roughly bundles in this zip does it make sense that people still use the zip who needs all those bundles at the same time anyways i can t answer this i believe that we would have to send a note to the cross project mailing list to get an answer if we do decide to keep this zip file then i would recommend adding a content xml and artifacts xml file to make the zip file a p repository do we need a duplicate directory structure or can we turn the bundles directory into a p artifact repository i believe this can be done there are just a few issues which stand in the way of our current directories being p artifact repositories a the bundles are stored in a directory called bundles by default the p simple artifact repository requires bundles to be in a directory called plugins for backwards compatibility reasons as you probably guessed so we have options here one is to rename the output folder in the orbit builds there are probably a few places in the scripts to rename the other option is to change the mapping rules in the orbit repository so it knows to look in the bundles folder instead of the plugins folder this can be done by us creating an empty template for the artifacts xml file which has the new mapping rule and copying this file to our destination before we run the build then new artifacts added to this repository will use the new rule and everything will work under the bundles directory b directory based bundles are stored as zip files this is interesting because all the source bundles and directory based bundles are zips but all bundles in p repositories are jar files do we intentionally make the zip files what will happen if we make jars instead so that s the summary what are your thoughts on this anyone who already has experience producing p repositories as part of their build have any comments ,1
CDT-218847,the user expected behavior when launching a new process is that the launched process is always expanded and if suspended the top stack frame of the first suspended thread is selected in dsf where the ui is completely event driven there needs to be an event which is generated by the launch which would inform the ui that the launch is complete and that expansion and selection should be updated in the debug view the event handling in the vm nodes should be the same as for modelproxyinstalledevent crafting an appropriate api for this could be tricky launches usually use ilaunchmanager to fire appropriate events and there is no such event as launch completed so the design of this event should first be discussed ,1

WTP_SOURCE_EDITING-296635, this bug was initially created as a clone of bug currently if a itaglibrecord is of type itaglibrecord url the jspdirectivevalidator processtaglibdirective function does not handle it the proper thing to do is to handle it like the other itaglibrecord types the only difference in this case is that a url taglib record only has a system relative path because it does not need to be inside the project so the project relative path has to be retrieved and checked weather the retrieved resource actully exists this means that taglib records inside the project will be added to the validation dependencies and those outside will not the wanted side effect of this is that the taglib records inside of the project will now be added as validation dependincies so if they change validation will be kicked off again this is usefull for if new tags are added to the taglib record and these tags are already in use by user code and marked with unknown tag validation errors these unknown tag validation errors will be cleared as soon as the tag is added to the taglib record where as before a manual validation would have to be kicked off patch to follow ,0

BIRT-147385,in the data set editor s parameters page the direction combo box always shows a choice of input output input output values the list of choices shown should be updated to reflect whether a custom data set supports input and or output parameters some users now have the mis impression that the jdbc sql select query supports output parameters because one can set its parameter direction to output a good indicator of which parameter direction values to display at least for oda data set types is by checking an oda design ui datasource extension s datasetui supportsinparameters and supportsoutparameters attributes in other words if supportsinparameters true and supportsoutparameters false only input direction choice is displayed supportsinparameters false and supportsoutparameters true only output direction choice is displayed supportsinparameters true and supportsoutparameters true input output input output direction choices are displayed,1

PDE-90514,this is effecively the same as bug but it wasn t filed against pde yet in the jar target in the generated build xml for a plugin there are paths to be found like the following pathelement path programme eclipse m eclipse plugins org eclipse osgi osgi jar this only works on other machines if eclipse is installed in the same directory structure as on the generating machine let alone eclipse on other platforms e g mac this is a problem mostly for custom true in the build properties when one starts off with a generated build xml it would be good if the eclipse install directory could be configured in the build properties i m using a custom build xml anyway only because i need some bytecode enhancement in the build process which is common at least with jdo based applications i m not very ant savvy but wouldn t it somehow be possible to configure a bytecode enhancing task incl classpath to be invoked between compilation and jar packaging i mean in a way that makes custom build unnecessary i don t really trust custom build xml because i never know what a newly generated build xml looks like and potentially must look like in future versions of eclipse ,1

LINUX_TOOLS-420220,since the introduction of the batch import wizard in the tmftracetype utility class holds a map of every defined trace type in the workspace one part is fixed as it is defined by extension points in plugin xml the other part is dynamic as it is defined by the user created custom parsers each trace type has a helper that owns a trace instance of that type since the custom trace type list is dynamic every time that batch import wizard is invoked the list is refreshed and new trace type helpers replace the old ones for each custom trace type this refresh is repeated for every trace type category in with the introduction of the event request scheduler each trace instance that owns an executor will spawn a timerthread that is used to yield execution to the next request periodically so now each trace type helper created by the tmftracetype utility class for the batch import wizard causes a timerthread to be created and live indefinitely in addition when a trace is opened an executor is created in the trace empty constructor and is immediately replaced during the trace initialization but the executor that was replaced is not shutdown so its timerthread also lives indefinitely the total number of such threads running is then equal to nb of fixed trace types nb of custom trace types x nb of categories x nb of times the batch import wizard is invoked nb of closed traces nb of opened traces in an ideal world this should instead be equal to nb of opened traces many issues contribute to the leak should the tmftracetype utility class really own one instance of each trace type forever when refreshing the custom trace types the discarded helpers should dispose their owned trace instance does the trace parent class tmfdataprovider really need to create an executor in the empty constructor since it is not needed until initialization when replacing the executor at initialization the old executor should have been shutdown since the utility class never initializes the trace instances that it owns just removing the creation of an executor instance in the trace empty constructor can probably solve the leak problem ,0

MDT.RMF-368037,once a presentation has been added to a reqif file it can be saved but not reopened any more unfortunately the stack trace is unrelated to the real problem java lang illegalargumentexception no reqif content found invalid reqif file at org eclipse rmf pror reqif editor presentation reqif editor openrif reqif editor java at org eclipse rmf pror reqif editor presentation reqif editor createpages reqif editor java at org eclipse ui part multipageeditorpart createpartcontrol multipageeditorpart java at org eclipse ui internal editorreference createparthelper editorreference java the real problem is that the backend first tries to instantiate a proxy object that will subsequently be replaced by the real object the object in question is prorpresentationconfiguration but this is an abstract class and therefore the proxy object cannot be instantiated for a concrete presentation the class to be used is a subclass that is of course concrete i e idconfiguration ,1
PDE-119668,we have recently introduced the notion of trays to jface dialogs the tray will be used to display context help and cheat sheets into any dialog however in order to get this those dialogs that used to subclass dialog directly must now subclass traydialog instead wizards and other titleareadialogs will get this for free the tray is created as needed so until it is populated there should be no noticeable difference in the dialog see bug this does not apply to very simple dialogs such as message dialogs that should never require any context help ,1

WTP_JAVA_EE_TOOLS-301477,this problem was found in an adopter product in one specific workspace every time wtp retarted the ear libraries classpath container would miscompute the fundamental problem was that even though the j eecomponentclasspathupdater received all necessary resourcechanged events to know to update all the classpath containers appropriately the timing was slightly off each module component needs to be added to an ear in order for the earlibraries classpath container to work this mapping is known as a reverse mapping because there is no meta data file defining which ear a component is in instead the ear s meta data file contains the list of components that belong to it the idependencygraph keeps track of these reverse mappings by reacting to resource change events and updating because the same resource changed event may trigger both the j eecomponentclasspathupdater and the idependencygraph to update it is possible that the j eecomponentclasspathupdater signals the earlibraries classpath container to refresh before the corresponding change has been reflected in the idependencygraph therefore the module has no ear to reverse map to and thus can not resolve its classpath entries the attached fix adds a notification mechanism to the idependencygraph which the j eecomponentclasspathupdater listens to this way the j eecomponentclasspathupdater will get an additional notification once the graph is completely up to date now that this notification is in place it may be possible to remove some of the iresourcechanged listening code from the j eecomponentclasspathupdater side this will likely occur in the stream ,0

JDT-58684,this is actually a jdt launching plugin issue not sure which component it belongs to in some cases the auto created default installed jre is named perhaps launching using eclipse this works ok as long as the user leaves this jre as the default and never creates a classpath entry pointing directly to this jre however if they make another jre the default or try to point specifically to this jre so that the classpath doesn t change to follow the default the classpath container doesn t work and their projects won t compile the reason for this is that ipaths are used to store classpath entries when you create a path like org standardvmtype the ipath is smart enough to simplify it to org standardvmtype the classpath container won t be able to resolve the jre and fails to compile the dialog to create a new installed jre already validates that you don t name a jre when the default jre is auto created it should make sure it does not use either ,0

SIRIUS-456351,currently the danalysis models reference points to the root elements of all the semantic models in the session this makes it difficult to defer loading the semantic resources until they are actually needed not impossible with very careful coding but very brittle in turn this has huge performance impact as semantic models can be very large this is part of a multi faceted problem but this ticket in particular is about replacing this plain emf ereference with an equivalent list of resource uris in a first transitional step the models reference could be kept but made volatile and deprecated and a new semanticresourceuris multi valued attribute introduced the corresponding resources would be loaded on session opening at the same time as they are now populating the models reference then we can eliminate the two cases where the models reference is needed in this form to distinguish semantic models belonging to this session from the other semantic resources in the resourceset which belong to other sessions this can only happen in the shared editing domain mode which must simply be removed to associate to this session additional semantic models which should be considered in the scope even though they are not referenced by any representation including transitively a concrete use case would be i have a uml diagram in my representations aird which references elements in app uml when editing elements in app uml through the diagram for example setting the type of a class attribute i want the elements in library uml to be loaded available even though nobody in either representations aird or app uml currently references that resource currently library uml is referenced by the danalysis models and is loaded on session startup we must find a way to support this use case without eagerly loading these additional resources both issues above will be handled in separate tickets and can probably be moved in parallel to this one once they are handled in a way that does not require the semantic models to be loaded on session startup the models reference could be removed in factor of the semanticresourceuris attribute maybe with some helper fa ade like session getsemanticemodels boolean forceload ,1

WTP_EJB_TOOLS-131406,i m not sure if this bug has already been opened but it is really confusing for novice users that an error message appears in the problems view immediately after creating a new ejb project the error is correct an empty ejb project is invalid but the message is poor and i ve had several users say that they think there was a problem in the wizard and even avoid creating an ejb which would fix the problem because they want to figure out what the problem is first not sure what the best solution is here changing the error to a warning might help or making the error text more readable another option would be to not do this particular validation until deployment or later in the cycle ,1

JDT-5651,please split the use src and bin folders as default in new java projects preference into two separate preferences as follows use src folder as default in new java projects use bin folder as default in new java projects the best way to describe why i would like this is to paste here a posting i just made to eclipse corner that describes how i work you will notice that i have to do a couple of extra steps to get rid of the src folder i would just like to eliminate those extra steps here is the post when i run eclipse i specify where i want my workspace to be i e c eclipse eclipse exe data d eclipse target so eclipse stores all of my projects in d eclipse target even though i am running it from c eclipse of course the java and class files are all mixed together which i don t like so when i create a java project i tell eclipse to create src and bin folders window preferences java use src and bin folders as default in new java projects now for one final step which i do because i don t like the src folder first i delete the src folder then i modify the properties of the project select project context menu properties and i also delete the src folder from the java build path source tab after this i usually select use the project as source folder in the source tab unless i want to have some other named source folders in the project not src in which case i just leave use source folders contained in the project selected at this point i am ready to start adding packages to my project the compiler puts all of my class files for the projet into the bin directory in d eclipse target myproject bin,1

PDT-171414,build id m steps to reproduce create an include path to a folder that has sub folders and contains php files referenced when you debug any file in the sub folders which are entered display an error saying the source cannot be displayed more information a simple form of the fix is in phpcompositesourcecontainer the line containers add new phpdirectorysourcecontainer file false project can be changed to containers add new phpdirectorysourcecontainer file true project and that allows it to search subfolders this may also be applicable to zip files however the issue might occur when you have files of the same name in different folders probably unlikely though where you could end up with the wrong file it may be that you don t want to search subfolders so maybe include path config should have an option in the future this was seen on rc ,1

GEF-27601,tordadt cmvc defect tvt ko garbage characters in the node name sev problem was reported during korean tvt testing and reproduced on a normal win box set to use a korean input locale the ime composes complex characters from simple ones as you type i e the user types a sequence of letters like vmf and each letter typed replaces the existing char with a newer more complex char the sequence vmffhdn is supposed to produce characters the way the composition is accomplished is the ime sends selection messages to the os text widget to select the character you just typed then when you press the next key the new character replaces the old one this works fine in swt text widgets e g properties dialog and normal stringcelleditors e g properties view however it doesn t work in direct edit both the flow editor and the logic sample are broken in direct edit when the user types a char a region off the end of the string is bogusly selected instead of replacing the last typed char each new char is appended to the string there s a flicker that looks as if the ime is selecting the proper char and then this selection is being whacked but i m guessing about that ,1

WTP_SERVERTOOLS-529600,this bug is similar to the following bugs can t create a new server if rename an existing one can t create a new server if rename an existing one steps are the same except i don t like the new behavior either steps to reproduce create a server using the default name rename the server in the server editor create a new server by launching the new server wizard the new server is not created the user is told he cannot create this server because its name is in use however when looking in the servers view there is no server visible with the name in question this is confusing to users i ll be submitting a patch but i m sure you ll find parts of it that are not clean or efficient enough so i encourage you to help me make it more suitable my patch will allow you to re use a server name by generating a unique id in the case that a name is not in use but the id is in use since having a situation where id name is already supported ie create a server and rename it now it has different name and id i do not feel generating a unique id is so terrible of a solution for this edge case ,1

CDT-256798,i sometimes get a null pointer exception because of the line getservicestracker getservice where the servicetracker is null after a bit of investigation i found this comment in dsfservicestracker java osgi service tracker explicitly listens to osgi service startup shutdown events and it will clear a reference to a service as soon as it s shut down this class leaves it up to the client to make sure that it doesn t access a service once that service has been shut down this seems to imply that calling getservice and getting a non null value does not guarantee the service to be there how else should we check if the service is still valid my actual problem is that gdbdisconnectcommand canexecute gets called after the iprocesses service has been shutdown however the call to getprocessservice inside that method will not return null because the dsfservicetracker does not keep track the the service is still valid so we end up calling iprocesses after it is shutdown any guidance ,1

BIRT-154972,current viewer implementation already supports anonymous emitters e g anonymous mime types for output but doesn t handle it well for emitter which registers its own mime type it shouldn t append charset utf in the head which could mess up the output the emitter itself will be responsible for the encoding for emitter which doesn t register a mime type it should use application octet stream instead of text htmlcharset utf a binary stream usually keeps more infomation than the text one and easy for user download i attached a patch to fix this problem ,0

PLATFORM-246839,looking at how ischedulingrule contains works there seem to be two semantic usage problems when a scheduling rule contains another one then a call to getjobmanager beginrule for a contained rule simply has no effect this means that by starting a rule that contains let s say all resources that s compliant with the api i can bypass any locking on resources in subsequent method calls to get it right a rule should contain another rule only if it also conflicts with this rule however because isconflicting has to be symmetric i cannot contain another rule the only way to do that is to use multirule which gets special treatment in the job manager we d like to understand what was the intention behind ischedulingrule contains and how to use it properly ,1

findloops loops newpath child null false if candidates null for int i i candidates length i iplugin candidate candidates i findloops loops newpath candidate null false this is what was my understanding of the method for an input plugin a iterate through all the plugins that a requires to find out loops back to a this method is recursive too ie kind of like depth first but the reason this method takes too much time is because it applies the method again and again for plugins that it has already encountered earlier but not found loops ie a b c d e f in the above diagram when i traverse the path a b c d e and i know that there exists no loop then the next time when i am on the path a f c i need not go ahead from c because i had encountered it earlier and did not found loops back to a the above can be easily done by the following adding an additional parameter to this method say a list or vector called exploredplugins whenever you traverse a plugin remember the number of loops before and after traversing the plugin if there has been no increase in the number of loops i e traversing this plugin and its required plugins results in no loops back to a then add this plugin to the list of exploredplugins that yield no loops by doing this the next time you encounter this same plugin recursive method you need not traverse the plugin after implementing the above the method looks like private static void findloops vector loops vector path iplugin subroot iplugin candidates boolean onlycandidates vector exploredplugins if path size test the path so far is the subroot the same as root if yes that s it iplugin root iplugin path elementat if isequivalent root subroot our loop dependencyloop loop new dependencyloop loop setmembers iplugin path toarray new iplugin path

time in dependency determination ms number of loops found loops after applying the above change time in dependency determination ms number of loops found loops without loops as it is without the above change time in dependency determination ms number of loops found loops after applying the above change time in dependency determination ms number of loops found loops so the editor was very much faster after the change i think i had opened an earlier eclipse bug about a similar problem in classpath cycle detection in java builder except that there they needed to detect if a cycle exists and here we also need all the cycles to display in the dependency page as the above was happening because i had hunderds of plugins in my workspace and almost many of them have org eclipse core boot org eclipse core runtime org xerces as a required plugin so the method ended up trying to detect loops and ended up with levels of recursive calls for the method findloops the above is a simple fix and from what i saw there was no obvious drawback to this approach and as i said i checked it with some scenarios and it did not eliminate any genuine loops please let me know if the above is useful in fixing the problem ,0

PLATFORM-84359,when caching site definitions by url in internalsitemanager getsite the update manager sometimes associates the wrong timestamp to the cached site this happens when the site url is http and refers to the directory containing site xml rather than site xml itself the update manager eventually finds site xml but when it goes back to get the timestamp it looks for the timestamp of the original directory url rather than site xml the wrong timestamp could mean that site xml changes on the server will not be picked up the usage of a directory rather than site xml directly is common possibly because the update site urls for eclipse work that way for example http update eclipse org updates a workaround is to directly refer to site xml files in the element of feature xml note that this problem does not occur for file urls because there is special code in fileresponse getlastmodified file f new file url getfile if f isdirectory f new file f site xml non nls lastmodified f lastmodified but i don t believe an analogous solution is advisable for httpresponse using m but the code looks the same in the current integration build ,1

TCF-402644,build identifier there is currently no easy solution for a tcf client to get the properties of a tcf server it is connected to and to identify it among the list of peers the issue was found when connecting to tcf agent running within simulators emulators e g qemu vmware or vxworks simulator that are using nat newtork address translation for network connection in this case the ip address and port number returned by the tcf locator getpeers cannot be used to identify the agent we are connected to because the port number used by the host to access the agent is not the port number knwown by the agent this is problematic for tools like system manager that would need to identify each agent to do special processing one solution to uniquely identify the agent is to use the agentid peer property but there is no way to retrieve this value for the server we are currently connected to the attached patch adds a getproperties command to the locator service that allows getting the properties of the server the client is connected to another solution would be to add this information to the hello message sent at connection but the new command seems to be more flexible reproducible always,1

PAPYRUS-428891,created attachment patch to remove error marker when valid value is entered in a cell if one copy paste rows from excel into a papyrus table the paste operation will create error markers for any cell with an incorrect value which is fine however entering a valid value afterwards manually does not remove the error marker even though the new valid value is actually taken into account note that entering a new valid value for a boolean cell is a bit tricky as the checkbox is actually hidden by the error marker and only the space toggling shortcut can be used to do it but it works any time a valid value is entered the tool shall check whether there was an error marker in the cell previously and if so remove it the attached patch fixes the pb although for boolean cell you still have to know the toggling shortcut to resolve the issue the code is inspired from code by vincent lorenzo ,1

TARGET_MANAGEMENT-411343,the only way of running commands remote at this point is in a asynchronous way by using hostshelloutputreaders that are notified when the output of the shell has changed in this way the end of running a command cannot be determined in a easy way except by waiting for a specific token using a locking mechanism which proves more time consuming than the alternative in order to be able to run commands synchronous we must be able to access the underlying reader of the host shell and this can be done by adding a plain getter in abstracthostshell class in this way the compilation is not broken for subclasses of this class since it always returns null the targeted classes local and remote can implement the getter local implementation is already there the reader can be accessed and the output can be read in a blocking way,1

ORION-393984,this bug is to discuss changes in the project folders layout and also what i call ability to make my own orion drop and i think those two items are related first some cases i create my orion based app which consumes just a small set of orion libs and uis i would like to have an easy way to pull what i need create my own drop and then keep it in sync with the latest orion i would like to consume just the orion editor i would like to deploy orion client code on tomcat or run as node js no osgi see the node js work from mark i would like to make work on this cases easier what i think would help is orion projects should not be eclipse plug ins to run such orion code on equinox we would need a special eclipse plug in that handles jetty mappings to run in other evns tomcat node js we would just need to create mappings right now you need to ripped off the code from eclipse plug ins first at first i thought we should put all the client code into one repo but now i think we should make a repo per each micro service we have registry plugins commands etc maybe the editor and put the rest into one repo i would also try to decouple auth and make it a separate framework these are just some initial thoughts any other thoughts ,1

WTP_SERVERTOOLS-104746,per discussion with tim the way the current tomcat junit tests are setup is that these tests will run only if a tomcat runtime is available this allows any developer to grab and run some of the tests without seeing failures and configure any tomcat runtime they have via the system property if they want to run all of the tests however there is some risk associated with this approach for example if releng breaks and never passes the tomcat install location system property down to the tomcat junit tests then the tomcat tests will be skipped on the download page you will not see any junit failures since we declare builds based on whether there are junit failures potential problems may not be discovered therefore i still think that the junit testcases themselves should have some protection against breakage from outside ,1

EMF.PARSLEY-494886,for some feature names e g etype in etypedelement the method name for polymorphic dispatcher will be something like control etypedelement etype since we use utility method to take a string and convert it to normal java variable name capitalization this normally means converting the first character from upper case to lower case but in the unusual special case when there is more than one character and both the first and second characters are upper case we leave it alone thus foobah becomes foobah and x becomes x but url stays as url param name the string to be decapitalized return the decapitalized version of the string java beans introspector decapitalize string to guess the feature name from the getter method when we search for methods polymorphically we search with the name of original feature which will be etype so we search for control etypedelement etype and the polymorphic search will fail we could make the predicate for method name less strict in special cases ,0

EQUINOX-207171,the expectation when calling engine perform is that either the set of installation operations is atomically done or not done during an install things can of course go wrong for a variety of reasons and we need to provide support in the engine to recover from these situations provisioningactions are our work unit and to support safe recoverability they should behave atomically in terms of state change an additional constraint that they must support is idempotence in particular we might need to redo or undo a partially completed action our goal here is to always leave a profile in a known or at least recoverable state many of our current actions do not require the saving state however some particularly actions that update an existing resource require the ability to snapshot the current state of a resource in order to safely provide undo support provisioningactions should be provided with a mechanism to log a memento in addition we should support checkpointing of the memento to allow easier undo logic the short term goal m is to provide in memory e g non durable support that provides the provisioningactions with a complete logging api that takes into consideration requirements for serialization this will allow improvement of the underlying implementation without affecting existingprovisioningactions longer term we need to look at durability and restart scenarios perhaps the frameworks reliablefile or commons transactions see bug might be good starting points ,1

MPC-316362,when installing software through the mpc the mpc consults all known p repositories to be specific when you select a component from the market place the mpc first computes the url update site for this component but then the install operation loads this url plus all other p repositories to determine the dependencies for example i have repositories listed in my available software sites and when i install a component through the market place all repositories are first fetched and loaded this approach has a number of problems performance the fact all repositories are first loaded means that all repositories must be reachable or we timeout trying for example at eclipsecon where we sometimes have a dedicated server if we hosted a marketplace on that dedicated server it would not matter because clients would still attempt to reach the outside world for each install this also means that as clients start using both p and the mpc to install things they will begin to face serious performance hits authenticity of what i m installing if i list a url for my component at the market place then i assume that this url will be the one consulted when the component is installed however if the same component is listed in more than one p repository then it s anybodies guess which repository will actually provide the component ,0

JAVA_SERVER_FACES-194927,i discovered this issue while looking at what was happening in bug in the jsffileurl class the determination of what url to use seems to come down to the order of the servlet mappings in web xml if an extension mapping is defined then that should typically be preferred for running in the test browser for example the jsf spec recommends faces as a default mapping these types of mapping is preferred because prefix mappings like faces introduce well known problems whereby relative path urls to non jsf assets html pages images etc all end up broken because of the virtual faces segment in the urls i think a more appropriate behavior for jsffileurl would be to check through every mapping first to see if any relevant extension mapping was available and only then falling back to the first prefix mapping as an aside the faces mapping was the one i saw removed because of since this mapping is listed in the jsf spec it may be appropriate to add it also by default along with faces ,1

EMF-303466,using cdo with dynamic packages is very error prone when one goes beyond the basic scenario of having a single package with no dependencies once one attempts to work with multiple interdependent packages out of the box there are various problems ecore xml sent to the server contains file references instead of nsuri references breaking dependency resolution on the server failure to resolve package dependencies on the client when packages are first used and sent to the server gives no error message failure to resolve packages dependencies on the server when packages are used in later transactions also gives no error message one can work around these problems by patching the ecore files using uri mappings forcing dependency resolution etc but it s all rather uninviting and very hard to debug when anything goes wrong for example when the client can resolve a package dependency but the server can not this goes undetected until there is actual transmission of data when the mismatch between the server s reading logic and the client s writing logic will probably lead to some low level error i believe we should invest in adding some checks to fail early with clear error messages and maybe add some mechanisms to relieve the app coder of having to think a lot about the subtle differences between generated packages and dynamic packages ,1

JDT-10393,i am opening this pr because an older pr containing this problem was just marked resolved worksforme which is not entirely accurate the older pr is http bugs eclipse org bugs show bug cgi id it is ok to close the older pr because the menu ordering problem has been corrected but the missing menu items problem is still very much there as of stable build go to type is missing from the hierarchy view open with is missing from class in packages view copy names is missing from the hierarchy view cut is missing from cu in packages view move is missing from type in packages and in hierarchy view should be able to move the type or the whole cu run debug is missing from the hierarchy view but the most important missing thing from any type is all of the team functions including the whole team menu and team items in the compare with menu and replace with menu i will paste a bitmap of menus side by side so that you can easily see where the gaps are in this diagram the menu on the left is the cu menu in the packages view the menu in the middle is the type menu in the packages view and the menu on the right is the type menu in the hierarchy view ideally all menus on types and cus in all perspectives should be analyzed in this visual manner i have not used the new vaj perspective much yet waiting for the types to be displayed in a hierarchy so i did not analyze those menus but i suspect strongly that we will discover inconsistencies and gaps if we look please if you don t do anything else add team support to types this was done in vame and it made a huge difference there is less mental and actual context switch required the current implementation in eclipse reveals that there is a framework behind everything and we do not want to let this show the user should have a seamless experience without so many context switches the case is that the cu type ratio is in the other case the tools should be able to figure out what the user meant or if it is unclear then just ask them ,1

WTP_SERVERTOOLS-327247, this bug was initially created as a clone of bug the following stacktrace is reported the issue is caused by the fact that during the iscancelled separate event loop is launched and debugplugin tries to save modified editor again reproduction steps are for eclipse based product but they give pretty good insight into the situation start was in debug mode from rad develop a dynamic web project v targeting was add a servlet with a sysout in doget add the project to was add a breakpoint inside doget debug the servlet so that it reaches the breakpoint click on the bug button in the debug view to restart the server in debug mode while the server is restarting add a new space char inside the doget method of the servlet if you do this while the server is still shutting down then you can save the servlet if you wait until when the server has initiated the restart then you cannot save the servlet you see a progress dialog with three entries restarting was server save starting was server if you wait for some time minutes then you will get a dialog asking if you want to save click ok now rad is still hanging and you see in the progress dialog save starting was building prerequisite project list however the server appears to be in started state at java lang object wait native method at java lang object wait bytecode pc compiled code at org

SIRIUS-482993,for bug on properties view part of the work the actual views rendering will be handled by code which resides in another project eef that code will need to evaluate interpreted expressions defined in sirius vsms we don t want to reproduce the existing sirius apis on the eef side and write and maintain all the dumb translation code between the two sides and we can not make eef depend on sirius itself which would cause a dependency loop a possible solution is to extract such an api from what exists already in sirius in a separate plug in or plug ins that while they live in the sirius project do not actually depend on the sirius core this will be the opportunity to modify the existing sirius api with long needed improvements e g in the area of variables management the current plan open to discussion is to provide a new api defined in new sirius plug ins with minimal dependencies ideally just emf maybe guava that was enough for the whole aql implementation so it should be enough for us too an implementation that translates the new api to the old one iinterpreter a way to obtain such a wrapper implementation from a sirius session for bug this means the sirius code which hands eef the views description will also give it an implementation of the new api which is backed of by the existing sirius interpreter with all the languages supported there eef will only need to depend on the new api not the wrapper implementation separately from the work on we ll progressively rewrite all the sirius code which uses the current old iinterpreter api to use the new one instead refining it in the process once this is done we ll deprecate the old api expose the new one dropping the wrapper implementation for more direct ones one for each supported language given this plan the goal of this new api is not only to break a dependency cycle with eef but also to fix improve the problems with the existing api cumbersome and error prone variable management inconsistencies between languages in coercion rules lack of feedback on interpretation result no support for query preperation compilation as mentioned above this is what i have in mind right now but almost all of it is open to dicsussion the only immediate need is for eef to be able to evaluate queries defined in sirius vsms without depending on the sirius platform itself ,1

ORION-390356,this has been bugging me for awhile but i ve not written a bug for it before now when we first started with orion we were influenced by the notion of shell services twenty things eclipse application services thus things that had been called out as pluggable dependencies in eclipse were deemed services in orion as orion has evolved it s clear that the command service who s main job is keep track of what commands are available enabled and to render them in standard ways is really not a service at all there s no notion of someone plugging in a different one there are no service extensions defined plug ins do not implement one etc in fact this makes use of the command service awkward because all calls have to deal with the asynchronous aspect of commands in fact we already have a problem where some code assumes that the command service is an in page object vs a service see bug comment i spoke to simon about this and he agrees that the command service is just a utility object vs a service post i d like to fix this cc ing mark i seem to remember there was some crazy workaround in one of the sites pages that had to deal with the fact that the command service was asynchronous mark do you remember what that was ,1

PLATFORM-260724,build id m a i am a performance analyst for an adopting product while doing an investigation of intermittent lock contention spikes i measured up to of build time attributed to lock spinning i found that a large portion of the contention was traced to spinning in the loop in workerpool startjob here s a discussion on the issue it appears that occasionally during a build of the workspace we get into a state where multiple workers just start hammering the the jobs synchronization locks mostly workerpool this and jobmanager lock back and forth for a while one of the biggest issues is in workerpool startjob worker the problematic state appears to result in jobmanager sleephint returning but jobmanager startjob still returning null thus we spin in the loop in workerpool startjob worker getting workerpool and jobmanager locks as fast as possible with enough threads trying to do this on a core machine lock contention explodes however i really can t pinpoint how we are getting into this state it appears that it has something to do with the number of jobs currently blocked jobs shouldn t be hanging around on the waiting queue for very long since when jobmanager nextjob is called the whole waiting queue should be cleared out if null is returned so the only other option appears to be that a job gets stuck on the sleeping queue and jobmanager sleephint returns from what i can tell though this also wouldn t make sense since if it s time for a sleeping job to wake up it should be moved to the waiting queue on the next call to jobmanager nextjob i suppose there is another option where the jobs just keep bouncing around causing the spinning i modified the inner loop in workerpool startjob to int nowaitcount while manager isactive job null long hint manager sleephint if hint nowaitcount sleep math min hint best before else nowaitcount avoid lots of looping without sleeps as it can lead to high synchronization costs with multiple workers if nowaitcount sleep nowaitcount job manager startjob if we were already idle and there are still no new jobs then the thread can expire synchronized this if job null system currenttimemillis idlestart best before numthreads busythreads min threads must remove the worker immediately to prevent all threads from expiring endworker worker return null in other words stop a single thread from zero wait spinning more than three times in a row measurements and traces showed that this single change reduced lock contention time as shown by tprof generally by about x and reduced contention on the workerpool inflated monitor as shown by jlm by x or more from john arthorne your assessment is consistent with mine if the startjob returns null it implies the wait queue is empty and there are no sleeping jobs that are ready to run the only case i can think of this happening is if multiple threads are awake at once in this loop if there was one job waiting the sleep hint would be for all threads but then only one thread will pop the job from the queue and the others will get null i think for safety we should insert a sleep in this case to avoid thrashing please enter a bug and i ll take a look at it perhaps a better solution than detecting the thrashing and mandating a sleep would be to fix the implementation of jobmanager sleephint to only return zero for one thread for each waiting job and return non zero for all other threads suggestion from chrisri us ibm com of course this could be tricky to implement ,0

PDT-160456,additionally there is no feature to enable mapped paths like there is with php dbg phpeclispe i have a path setup as follows c projects myproject htdocs lib cmyclass php http mybox has a document root set to c projects myproject htdocs thus when i pick the index php in the debug configuration screen it creates a url as follows http mybox htdocs index php which is of course totally wrong the problem is that the current configuration dialog cannot cope with projects that either a have a document root that is somewhere other than the root b has a server that uses rewrite rules and c has files that live outside of the project correct me if i m wrong all files and urls needs to be passed though a mapper which is how php dbg and phpeclipse works and it does it right of the time even for compliated project layouts when the webserver opens a file it knows where the files are located as the debug module runs in the webserver the debug module can know about the urls and their absolute paths the web server s debugger module should then send full path to the debug client in php ide then php ide should run this though a path mapper to determine the correct local paths using the scenario about i would have a path map as follows remote path c projects myproject htdocs local path c projects myproject htdocs notice something they re the same paths so why a path mapper you re asking if i moved my project from c projects myproject to n projects myproject and n was a network drive on a remote webserver that had a url of http dominic remotebox which had a document root of d share dominic projects myproject htdocs i would create a mapping as follows remote path d share dominic projects myproject htdocs local path n projects myproject htdocs for complicated projects that have symlinked folders you normally need more than one mapping e g if you have or more clients using a shared set of library code that lived on d web common lib which was symlinked to by d share dominic projects myproject lib you would need another mapping as follows remote path d web common lib local path n projects myproject lib additionally rewrite rules are catered for here because the webserver s debugger module always knows the absolute path of the file being using as it takes place after the rewrite rule has applied path mapping also opens the door for cross platform remote debugging as the path mapper can translate unix style relative paths into windows style drive letter relative paths too a path mapper only looks at the first part of the file being opened so if using my second example i had file called d share dominic projects myproject htdocs anotherfolder anotherentrypoint php it would only look at the paths in the path mapper s list before replacing with the local path to the file would be resolved to n projects myproject htdocs anotherfolder anotherentrypoint php further more in the debug ui the url should probably not be automatically built as it doesn t make sense most of the time you could have a guess button to the right of the url text box though you should be able to specify the webserver s document root and optionally a context path the path mapper would use the document root to determine where to open files from it should also be the remote webserver s document root if the project s path and the document root are the same then no path mappings are required please implement asap as this is a very important when doing anything other than basic php scripts sites remember it s the larger sites that actually need a debugger so those are the ones you need to cater for ,1

EQUINOX-225843,created attachment patch at present secure preferences don t differentiate between null values and empty strings in fact nulls passed in are converted to empty strings the patch adds a differentiation the null values will omit separator between salt and value and will have both as empty strings the null values won t be encrypted so the entry in the output file will be simple t the patch adds an extra junit to check for edge values for strings and byte arrays as a part of the this work i discovered that i needed to check if we are runing inside a junit before bringing up ui prompts there is a code added that checks first to see it workbench is active and then checks if the application is org eclipse pde junit runtime ,0

PLATFORM-87371,whenever i try to open help via help help contents i get a browser showing http file not found the problem goes away when i remove my user level environment variable tmp which is pointing to i tmp when i remove this user level environment variable the system level variable becomes active which is set to c windows temp yet on a colleague s machine modifying environment variables does not help and he never gets the eclipse help system to work i m pretty sure that the problem did not exist with eclipse and appeared the first time when i installed btw i m using jre my personal feeling is that the problem might be due to tomcat policies forbidding access to some classfiles which are cached by the jvm in a jarfile cache in the tmp directory this suspicion is because

MYLYN-166540,i work behind an authenticated proxy at work and at home i can either go through the proxy through my vpn or go straight to the internet i find that mylar and eclipse have trouble when i try to define an external url like the repo url when i m behind the proxy it just says unknownhostexception bugs eclipse org i ve defined all of my proxy settings correctly i believe i have no trouble before version of mylar i was at least able to have my bugzilla repo defined while off the proxy from home but afterwards it could still sync even while on the proxy it was only jira that still failed to sync while on the proxy now on version i can t do anything with task repositories while on the proxy the settings won t validate and syncs fail with the uhe one thing that seems curious to me is that with there are optionally separate proxy settings for each task repository which seems odd as you re still coming from the same place no matter where the repo is the proxy settings for each repo shouldn t be different the other curious thing is that it refers to the install update settings in the preferences i assume in those settings you can set the proxy host port but not the user pwd if i don t have the install update checkbox set then i can set the user pwd for each repo which is again redundant as that shouldn t change for each repo if i enter those proxy values while on the proxy it won t let me store them as i get no bugzilla server found at url also note that when i plug that same url into my web browser it has no trouble getting there it almost seems like the url validation is not done through httpclient in a way that is not using the proxy ,0

SIRIUS-456771,currently installing any functional sub set of sirius requires plug ins like org eclipse sirius ui which in addition to code also contribute ui elements this forces the ui elements to be visible to all users as soon as parts of sirius are present on the system with no possibility to opt out except maybe using things like activities we should make it possible to have parts of sirius installed without polluting the general eclipse ui with our views perspectives actions etc for contexts where they do not make sense ideally this would be done with a fine grained highly modular platform structure and we want to get there eventually but in the meantime low cost and low risk improvements are possible for example by moving the extensions contributions of some elements in new plug ins separate from the ones where the code lives there is some analysis required of the current ui contributions we have and how to organize them into meaningfull categories so that whichever combination of plug ins is installed the ui is always consistent for example the model explorer view can make sense without the modeling perspective but not the other way around the preferences page shoudl always be present and does not pollute the ui etc ,1

EQUINOX-159506,build id i i have been playing around with using org eclipse equinox ds within the org eclipse core jobs bundle but was having great difficulty because it always seemed to fail silently i finally found that it is discarding all exceptions and warning messages because there is no logservice registered this is in the class org eclipse equinox ds log it seems that either the equinox ds component should have a backup plan when the log service is not available such as writing to std err or the framework should register an implementation of logservice that forwards to frameworklog otherwise there will be no error reporting when org eclipse equinox ds is used in conjunction with the org eclipse osgi runtime ,1
